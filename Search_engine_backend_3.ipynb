I also spammed a whole lot of wakame, spring onion and crispy tempura bits (yumz). If you're a big eater, you can also choose to upsize your bowl from a Regular to a Large at no extra cost! 😝 Their Udon is seriously one of the best I've had; thick with a nice springy bite. I don't usually drink much of the broth, but their broth is also super addictive that I finished almost every single drop of it! Their prices are already very affordable but with @entertainersg 's 1for1 , my meal was made even more pocket-friendly! 💯 #burpple #burpplesg #udon #japanesefood #japanesecuisine #noodles #entertainerapp #udonnoodles #beef #beefudon #tamoyaudon #whati8todaysg #whati8today #sgeats #eatmoresg #singaporefoodlisting #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodhunt #sgfoodhunter #sgfoodtrend #myfooddiary #sgfooddiary #sgcafe #sgcafefood #sgcafehopping #foodforfoodie #foodforfoodies #foodexplorer\", 'senti': 0.99033254}, {'re.name': 'Tamoya Udon (Liang Court)', 'r.review': \"@tamoyasg offers a decent range of noodle dishes - primarily udon - to choose from.:You can also find a variety of tempura and rice balls to select from via self-service.

The tobiko provided a crunchy texture while the mentaiko with its rich, thick and almost paste like texture gave the udon a silky dimension. The tamago when broke apart further accentuates the silky texture making the udon nice to slurp on. The Oooh-mami Udon is handmade udon noodles coated with rich XO sauce. Toss the noodles together with dried sakura ebi, fresh spring onions and bonito flakes. An onsen egg sits perched on the bowl of noodles. The curry beef onsen udon are coated in rich, fragrant Japanese curry sauce. The tender and flavorful beef slides sits atop with flowy onsen egg blanket in rich creamy curry that will sure warm your soul. Tamoya's house-made silky noodles are nest enjoyed in fragrant bonito soup with tender beef slides to enjoy the most authentic flavors or zest is up with a soft flowy onsen egg that will give that extra oomph. Tamoya Udon boasts a total of 31 outlets across Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. Their soup and udon are handmade on site with love with ingredients imported from Japan to ensure the most authentic Japanese cuisine is served to their diners.
