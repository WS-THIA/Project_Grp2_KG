                "RestaurantAddress": "\n, Singapore\n",
                "Review": "Gave Otoke Chicken at Asian Food Mall in Lucky Plaza a try recently; a new Korean fried chicken stall which gives a slight impression of being a 4Fingers Crispy Chicken spinoff given the packaging of the paper cups here. A little odd considering how it's located beside Jollibee within the same food court, but Otoke Chicken works for those who are looking for a sauced-up (quite literally) fried chicken treat. \nLiked how the fried chicken here was not too greasy here; the chicken being pretty tender and succulent. Opting for the Spicy Sauce, the Spicy Sauce comes pretty piquant and is not shy in terms of its spiciness — the heat being pretty prominent and lingers around which works well for spicy lovers; all that whilst carrying a slight savoury and sweet note of sweet soy typical of Korean fried chicken. While the fries come with a generous seasoning of honey soy powder for flavour, we were not fans of the soft fries; whilst not being drenched in oil, it was peculiarly limp and soggy within — would have preferred some crispness on the exterior and fluffiness within. That being said, it's not a bad eat; in fact a pretty decent option to go for — perhaps albeit of a bad location for how it may draw some unfair comparisons with its more famous neighbour, but it satiates the Korean fried chicken cravings just about right at an individual-friendly size and a reasonable price."

Moving into a new HDB estate just across the road, Creamier is all that we remembered — that includes the small shop space (albeit more spacious considering how there seems to be a bigger gap in between tables now for more privacy; just less claustrophobic than before) and the long queues snaking within the shop itself. \nHad to give the Buttermilk Waffles a go; pretty much the go-to waffle that we have always known, though this time sitting atop a disposable plate — the waffle is crisp on the outside and plush in the inside, wafting of a buttermilk fragrance while the chocolate sauce and maple syrup helps to elevate the aroma even further. Going for the Chng Tng Sorbet, the sorbet is churned with dried longan for light and refreshing note reminiscent of the local dessert with a bite; a contrast to the classic Sea Salt Gula Melaka which carries a deep sweetness with a balanced note of saltishness — simple yet satisfying, and a flavour that is well-associated with the brand these days. Still the spot to head to for satisfying ice-cream and waffles in the heartlands — that is considering if one exercises some patience and is able to make a little sacrifice to comfort whilst dining in"

From the new Pano Kato Grill, Pizza & Deli at Tanglin Mall, opened by the same folks behind House of AnLi which is better known for their Aussie-style brunches and contemporary cuisine. \nThis is off their Josper Grill menu; essentially meats sourced from Australia that is grilled using charcoal and wood from their Josper oven. Really enjoyed the Chicken Souvlaki here; the greens being even more amazing than the meat itself. Don't get me wrong; the chicken is really lovely on its own; the lack of seasoning helps to bring out that smoky, charred notes from that cooking process, but the greens are immensely juicy yet carrying a myriad of flavours from the distinct notes of the capsicums to the crunchiness of the onions. The onion bulbs and roasted garlic were truly amazing however; all sorts of juicy yet soft to the bite — absolutely wonderful. Needless to say, whilst we only had just a small selection of the sides and the desserts, we would certainly be back for more; the food, the vibes — all the things I would want to sink into on a leisurely weekend."

One of the new items available at Atlas Coffeehouse which had since reopened after an extensive renovation which carries a different look from before. \nEssentially almost akin to Pineapple Fried Rice spiked with chunks of bacon all over, the rice comes slightly sweet yet with a hint of curry spice, made savoury from the bits of bacon that speckled throughout the entire bowl. The Organic Jammy Egg is done to a texture where the egg yolk is a little hardened but still creamy, though not oozy and flowy like a typical sous-vide egg; I would have probably preferred having it sous-vide or molten to allow the yolk to better mix into the rice for better flavour. That being said, the caramelised onions were extremely on-point with its sweetness — a very distinct note that works extremely well with the rice while the sour cream, though a little unnecessary for me, does help in providing a slightly neutral flavour yet adding some creaminess into the dish. Everything is still done as per standards familiar to Atlas Coffeehouse, Colombus Coffee Co., and Lunar Coffee Brewers; pretty excited to give the other new items a go another time."

Apart from serving up Bak Chor Mee in both dry and soup options, Bedok Bak Chor Mee also serves up other sides, as well Ngoh Hiang and a rotating menu of local desserts. \nGoing with the Crispy Prawn Cracker, Yam Roll, Water Chestnut Cake and QQ Pork Sausage, one could tell how the ingredients are pretty fresh and fried quite well; none of the fried fritters felt overly greasy nor soaked up in oil — items were pretty crisp whilst the meatier items come with a good bite and pretty juicy. The accompanying chili was also great; a good balance of sweetness and mild spiciness that provides a contrast of flavours. Something which is great to share around the table with the Bak Chor Mee that is to be ordered here."

Now the same airy croissant that perfumes of the floral notes now come with an cream cheese filling — the filling isn't particularly heavy; one would get a light tinge of tartness whilst the cream cheese helps add a soft and creamy texture provides a contrast of textures which seems fitting to the croissant. Spiked with a little bit of the Earl Grey Lavender, the Earl Grey Lavender Cream Cheese also helps to elevate those floral notes even further from the sugar glazing; pretty lovely indeed."

                "Review": "Wasn't intending to dine here at the first place, but ended up here somehow after a failed attempt of having Dim Sum elsewhere. Must say that this was actually worth the detour (or even the trip); the Mee Pok here is well-executed considering the many elements that went into the bowl. Really liked how the noodles gave a good bite; pretty much \"al-dente\" whilst coming with a lot of goodies such as pig liver, pork slices, fried beancurd skin, minced pork and even clams for just $4.00. The sauce was great for the most part; a balance in between bring vinegary and spicy, while the clam is pretty fresh and a great addition. The inclusion of fried beancurd skin was a hit with me too; whilst being a replacement for the crispy pork lard, it's definitely less greasy than what it replaces — very delicious on its own. Would totally opt for the Signature Mee Pok next time; coming with even more goodies like scallops and prawn paste, it sounds pretty worth the price of $6.00 that it commands."

From FarmAppetit; a new establishment which had taken over the former premises of KEK Seafood Pandan Gardens. \nServing up pretty much Western fare with their very own twist, this item comes with a Japanese influence and a very slight local twist. Really enjoyed the Seafood Miso Tamarind Broth; a savoury and light broth that was pretty clean in terms of flavour and easy to have — went well with the flavours of the salmon which was fresh and came with a brown rice crust that gives it a good crunch. Other items such as the Daikon provides a soft bite, while the bamboo shoot gives a crunch; the Leek Tempura also giving a good bite whilst being crisp and all. Pretty liked how this dish was just something that warms up the heart; very clean notes yet with a variety of textures. A little pricey considering the neighbourhood it is located at, but a place that is certainly a hard find in this area of Singapore."

                "Review": "From Bacha Coffee, a new coffee room at ION Orchard which had taken the space opposite Nespresso on Level 1; a space that had been vacant for quite a while which saw various plans for quite a number of F&B establishments that did not turn into fruition. A brand that hails from Morocco, the coffee room at ION Orchard is their very first of such concepts internationally. \nServing up Moroccan dishes for the hot food selection and a wide variety of viennoiseries, pastries and desserts, the 1910 Coffee and Chocolate Croissants come in a portion of two for a serving. Coming with coffee flower honey on the side, the croissants came aptly flaky and buttery; the infusion of coffee helps to add a light hint of earthiness and roastinese to the croissant, while a knob of chocolate helps to provide a sweetness to the pastry. Sprinkled with sea salt over the top, the sea salt adds on to the butteriness, further enhancing those flavours. The coffee flower honey is not quite required here, considering how the chocolate helps to provide some sweetness to the croissants — that being said, it still adds a nice sticky and gritty texture similar to raw honey with a floral sweetness that is absolutely alluring. A spot that would most probably be a tai-tai hangout for a pot of coffee after a day's worth of shopping — the TWG-esque Moroccan vibes with the classical music here is what I absolutely dig, with the impeccable service which is just very much on point."

Coming with their signature Mac & Cheese sauce, mix salad, garlic breadcrumbs and mozzarella cheese, this would appease the younger folks and hipsters alike with its cheesiness — the sauce carries a flavour similar to that of nacho cheese sauce; the flavours more tuned down here so it does not get too jelak throughout the serving, while the macaroni provides a good chew. The melted mozzarella cheese atop helps to provide a oozy, stretchy and stringy texture, while the garlic breadcrumbs provide a slight crispness to the entire deal. The greens attempt to help to balance things out a little, giving a good break in between spoonfuls of the Classic Mac & Cheese — did not find it absolutely necessary to include the Goma dressing, but certainly good to have. A pretty decent item to consider sharing at the table for a light bite, or something to have individually for a decently-sized sinful treat at the hawker centre."

Serving up a variety of Western cuisine (some carrying a local influence), the Seared Atlantic Seabass with Lentils was an item that we felt was pretty decent for its price of S$16.00. \nComing with a crisp skin from the searing, the fish was still considerably flaky with some moisture being locked within; its flavour enhanced by the white wine sauce which was all savoury and buttery, while the accompanying greens such as the braised cabbage provides a familiar, soft crunch providing the local infusion for this item. The long beans further helps to provide more texture, while the lentils gave a soft bite to even things out. A pretty decent item to go for here; given how Manna is decked out, it does make for a good spot for a relaxed date or casual lunches in the day with rattan and wood furnishings with the sunlight pouring in from the full length windows on the facade — a spot that is worth considering to dine at when in the area."

Dropped by Onalu, which had recently opened its doors at Singapore Management University, School of Accountancy replacing Kraftwich by Swissbake which previously sat in its premises. Offering SMU students and staff with a choice for healthy food, Onalu serves up a variety of smoothie bowls (i.e. Acai Bowls) and Bagel-wiches. \nOpting for the Onion Bagel with our order (other choices of bagels include Sesame Bagel and Plain Bagel), the Smokin' Sally is a great choice for a classic combination of condiments with their own twist. Really enjoyed the bagel for how it carries a firm bite without feeling overly dense nor heavy; the onion shallots speckled on the exterior providing a slight garlicky hint of flavour which went really well with the entire Bagel-wich. Unlike other similar bagel-wiches served at other joints, the cream cheese spread is in no way heavy or overwhelmimg; the infusion of chives help to keep things light and refreshing, neutralising and cutting away any of that jelak feel usually associated with cream cheese whilst the creamy texture that binds all of the elements together. The smoked salmon is fresh, providing the bagel-wich with a distinct brininess of cured fish that is not overpowering in terms of saltishness. Overall, a very well put-together package altogether; a well-executed item that's fairly reasonable for its price point (i.e. $8.90 for public; a dollar off for SMU students and staff). Certainly lucky to be a student these days with such quality and value-for-money locations opening on campus worth the occasional splurge — all that without the sin."

                "Review": "M E D I A T A S T I N G\nThe two things I noticed immediately about @MAI_by_marusaya when I walked in were: firstly, how spacious the place is, and secondly, that the customers (I could hear their happy chatter despite them being mostly out of sight) were Japanese, thereby immediately vouching for the restaurant’s authenticity.\nI was there (courtesy of @brandcellar) to have the $128++ Omakase Dinner Menu by Group Executive Chef Shinji and Head Chef Ono. And although everything they served was fine (I found the “Dobinmushi with Shrimp, Shimeji and Maitake Mushroom”, and the “Grilled Matsutake Mushroom Rolled with Seared Wagyu Beef” especially enjoyable), there‘s no doubt in my mind the highlight of the meal was their new range of Japanese Donabe (claypot) Rice featuring the brand’s specialty dashi made from 2-year aged katsuobushi and seasonal produce air-flown from Japan twice a week.\nCooked to order over a slow fire, each Donabe Rice took about 30 to 40 minutes to be ready but the wait was worth it. The aromas and flavours were distinctly richer and deeper than if an ordinary pot had been used.\nOf the four I got to try, the “Seared Sliced Wagyu Donabe Rice” ($58++) was my favourite as it’s the most flavourful and indulgent with butter and an egg yolk mixed in (thanks to Chef Ono, I even got riceballs of this to take home at the end of the night). Tying for second place were the pretty and tasty “Japanese Barracuda with Chrysanthemums Donabe Rice”, and the “MAI Style Chicken Donabe Rice” which is an oishii (Japanese for “delicious”) take on our local chicken rice complete with its own packs-a-punch chilli sauce ($38++ each). Those who desire something very clean in taste can pick the “Matsutake Mushroom Donabe Rice”.\nDo note that you do not get a whole pot of Donabe Rice with the $128++ omakase menu. It would be just a bowl of your chosen variant. I guess after consuming all the courses preceding and the dessert that comes after (I was presented with a slice of housemade sweet potato cake, matcha ice-cream and azuki red beans), it would be enough for most."

Fast forward a year and ten months. Thanks to T.H.’s friends, Edmund and Serene, the veil over my eyes has been lifted. It’s like I have been inducted into a secret society of sorts, one that knows it is the claypot dishes which are the real stars of this place. Edmund ordered three of them that night for our dinner: the “yong tau fu”, the chicken with salted fish and the bittergourd with sliced beef short rib. I loved them all! Very fragrant, boldly seasoned and super tasty, they were best enjoyed with plain rice. The other dishes we had, the simple steamed egg and the stirfried broccoli with fresh and dried scallops, were really satisfying too. Of course if you have been following my posts on Instagram, you would already know how blown away I was by the astonishingly delicious sweet and sour pork. That dish deserved its own post."

The original Bacha Coffee, built in 1910, is still housed in the Dar el Bacha palace or “House of the Pasha” and if you explore online, you can see how beautiful it is. Naturally, the Singapore venue is nothing but stunning as well. Coffee-lovers will have a field day here as it houses over 200 single origin 100% Arabica coffee beans from farmers in Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central and South America, the Caribbean, Asia and beyond. From fine flavoured and fine blended coffees to naturally C0₂ decaffeinated coffees, there is something for every palate. The company’s focus is on achieving the perfect roast and grind to accentuate each coffee’s unique qualities and complexities, and I had the pleasure of trying three types (each pot costs $9++) beginning with the strongest, a Single Origin from Ethiopia’s Sidamo Mountain. It had a spicy, fragrant aroma, very full body as well as floral and cracked cocoa bean notes. From the fine blended coffee range, I was served the malty-flavoured, nutty-overtoned “Three Volcanoes” that contained Central American and Arabian beans. It was my favourite of the lot. Named “1910 Coffee”, the third was a fine example from the fine flavoured section with its mesmerising fragrance of strawberries and cream. I think it might be the one that can convert the non-coffee drinkers because it’s really lovely, especially with some chantilly cream or milk (these accompany every order of coffee here).\nTo be frank, I wasn’t expecting a lot from the food because at first look, I thought it might be a “style over substance”. How wrong I was! The food menu may not extensive but what I had by Head Chef Jeremy and Pastry Chef Ryo were very good. These are what I recommend: the superbly buttery Croissants ($8++ for 2), the Scrambled Eggs with Truffle and #brioche that’s TO-DIE-FOR ($24++), the Tiramisu with Rwanda Superior Coffee (love its incredibly luxurious mouthfeel) and the Strawberry Soup with vanilla ice-cream, a most delightful and refreshing creation ($12++ per dessert)."

Because, once you exit the lift on the top floor and pass through the dark passage, your jaw will surely drop at the view before you, and pretty much stay dropped as you take in the entire VUE within and without.\nGeneral Manager Benedict Tan is warm and friendly, and because he played a major role in the set-up of VUE, deeply knowledgeable, so you can ask him anything you like. Executive Chef Sam Chin hails from Penang and he has come up with a menu that doesn’t attempt to be gimmicky or complicated, focusing instead on executing the usual beloved suspects very well. The beverage menu is masterminded by Head Sommelier of OUE Restaurants Joel Lim who happens to be the 2018 Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Singapore Sommelier Champion. Together, they and the team strive to ensure every visitor’s evening at VUE is one to remember, just like they did for us.\nWe began with spritz cocktails (it is their speciality) and complimentary canapés at the bar before being led on a tour of the premises by Ben. When he showed us the private dining room which seats a maximum of 12 and has a minimum spend of $800 for lunch and $1,600 for dinner, I immediately thought what an ideal spot it would be for business lunches and intimate meals with those you hold dear.\nWe then proceeded to the main dining room where dinner was served. After the housemade breads came fresh La Friandise oysters from France and an excellent charcuterie platter. A zingy ceviche of halibut from Kyushu and Hokkaido scallops was next before the main event of binchotan-grilled Emperor A5 Wagyu. The exquisitely fatty steak was accompanied by a few solidly done sides.\nDinner finished with chestnut ice-cream and mousse in a cocoa nib tuille, with fresh and freeze-fried raspberries and grated truffle.\nWe also enjoyed all the wines selected by Joel throughout the meal.\nA surprise element of the night was the elegant light show on the extremely high, curved ceiling of the dining room. Scheduled to take place at 8.59pm every night, it is a prelude to MBS’ laser light show that’s also visible from every seat at VUE."

If you’re familiar with Korean food, you’ll know that their portions are usually huge, so downsized options for lonesome individuals are a godsend!\n#jjangjangmyeon #tangsuyuk #koreanfood #seoulfood #food #foodporn #burpple #PPGinSeoul #RXgetsfatSeoul #belikerachelx"

My favourite of the lot, the Soy Sauce Chicken 油鸡 ($8/lower quarter & $7/upper quarter) was succulent, savoury and saucey - perfect with a steaming bowl of rice. The Char Siew 叉烧 ($10 portion) was also well-executed though they were sliced much thinner than I preferred in order to cater to the more elderly customers that they get at the coffeeshop. Similarly, the Roast Duck 当归烤鸭 ($12/lower quarter & $11/upper quarter), which was initially done with a more pungent hit of dang gui was toned down with the feedback of the diners. Yet as one who loves a stronger herbal flavour, I am still able to appreciate the subtleness and the pairing with the natural sweetness of the meat. The mee kia too, was cooked to a springy perfection.\nThank you @alhsx for the kind invitation and @jthejon for the hospitality!\n.\n📌Tong Luo Wan 铜锣湾\nJin Biao Coffee Shop 锦标咖啡店\nBlock 136 Potong Pasir Ave 3\n#Burpple #burpplesg #sgfoodie #foodagram #sgfoodies #sgfood #foodsg #foodspotting #foodiesg #throwback #8dayseat #eatoutsg #iweeklyfood #sgeats #sgeatout #igsg #sgig #openrice #stfood #foodphotography #igdaily #igfood #instafood #foreverhungry #charsiew #roastduck #soysaucechicken"

                "Review": "Among all the dishes from Uni Gallery’s latest 6-course Multiple Foodgasm Kaiseki, the Tempura Truffle Chawanmushi ($20/ ala carte) stole the show for me. Seemingly simple on paper, the dish was heavenly and certainly an item I can see myself going back for again and again. Warm, silky yet complex in flavor, you get the lightness of the dashi which sets the base of the steamed egg custard then layer that with the earthy aroma of the shaved winter truffle. And to push it over the top, the crisp tempura had the richness of uni and the grassy note of the shiso leave wrapped within. "

Wee bit expensive but definitely one of the best around so far. The chicken was so thick and very juicy! Sweet-savoury, the batter was crispy.

Spare parts. Red Curry Mixed Veg and their signature braised pork. It’s all in the dipping sauce that makes it Thai. Chicken is tender and soft a bit similar to our local Hainanese or Cantonese style chicken without the gelatinous layer. Braised Pork, the mrs said her version is much better. It’s not bad lah, but can’t compare to Mrs Lim’s version. Lol. The Red Curry Mixed vegetables is nice, if only it was even spicier it would be nicer. We like it spicy. Thai Milk Tea is not as sweet as we thought it will be, so we are happy. We quickly ate, laid and left because there was a queue waiting. Need to do our weekly groceries after lunch."

You get six pieces of spinach and ricotta ravioli in truffled mushroom cream, with a dome-shaped bread cover that’s cut open upon serving. Found the ravioli skin to be a bit too thick, but we still enjoyed it a lot as a whole! \nTruffle was subtle, but the sauce was more like a thick and creamy mushroom soup with generous chunks of mushrooms. It was great for dipping with the bread cover that was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. \nLa Pizzeria was a little out of the way, but we sat outdoors and was rewarded with a pretty sunset. Another plus point, Burpple Beyond is available here for 1 for 1 pizzas/pasta!"

There are only two soup variations on the menu of the world's only Michelin-starred ramen restaurant — shio (salt) or shoyu (soy sauce). Both soup bases stem from a chicken stock boiled with vegetables, clams and seafood for additional depth — think of it as soul-warming chicken noodle soup. Go for the crowd favourite Char Siu Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($22.80) that comes with the full works — four slices of char siu, flavoured egg, bamboo shoot and leek. The Tsuta rendition gets an unexpected umami boost from the scoop of truffle pureed in truffle oil. Otherwise, shio purists will enjoy tucking into the Char Siu Ajitama Shio Soba ($22.80). It comes with the same toppings, except that the the truffle is replaced by green olives in truffle oil.\nAvg Price: $25 per person\nPhoto by Burpple Tastemaker Eleanor Tay"

It’s a supplement for $10, but definitely felt more like a staple instead. I mean, who can resist that huge slab of wholesome goodness right? It’s pretty much like a show where the supporting actor steals the limelight, but I’m not complaining anyway, at least not about this dish. The dishes to follow however, made me feel like V meant vertical, and when I mean vertical, unfortunately it also means downwards. I’ll leave that for another post.\n•\n[Hosted] #singaporefood #singaporefoodies #sgfood #eatoutsg #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #foodhunting #singaporefood #sgfoodguide #exploreflavours #igfood #instafood #instafoodsg #burpple #FoodPics #foodphotography #WhereKarlEats #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgfoodblogger #sgfinedining #hungrygowhere #foodiesofinstagram #exploresingaporeeats #vdiningsg #thedailybite #foiegras"

Unlike the starchy oyster eggs we're used to, the version here is an omelette topped with a generous portion of plump oysters. Burppler Hwans Lim highly recommends coming with a group of four or more to share the Fish Steamboat (market price). It comes ladened with plenty of fresh fish slices, yam cubes and tomatoes. Also worth sharing are the XL-sized Homemade Prawn Roll (Hei Zho)($8) — unlike other places where the hei zho comes in bite-sized pieces, here they do a lemon-sized version that requires more than a bite to finish.\nAvg Price: $20 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Jeremy Tan"

Quite unique and well executed\nThe highlight is obviously the braising liquid which is definitely the best I've had so far. It's savoury slant and full bodied flavours easily beats out the sweet or herbaceous kinds that you have elsewhere, but that might be my own preference. To put their already excellent braising sauce over the top though, they sprinkle sesame oil to make it more fragrant and i feel it's really spoiling the market. Duck meat wasnt the most tender but still pretty good\nUsually there's sambal and lime chili, but over here the thicker chili alr has sour notes. The lime chili however, was pure sour and unrelenting heat so dont go crazy on it from the start\nUnfortunately their braised Pork was tough and flavourless, and its extremely rare i dont recommend pork lol. Their soup was also way too sweet, i stopped after a couple spoonfuls"

Only a little off from perfection, but its flaky texture easily beats out the more common types of Fish. Fish Eggs were passable at best, over cooked and slightly hard, fishy as well. If u have to order the Fish Eggs remove them from the soup asap to prevent overcooking.\nTheir sauce is a variation on the usual chili lime sauce, and is the only thing saving the Fish Eggs. Rather unique esp in looks, and i particularly liked that the chili was just a hint"

Their sambal, which was added on accident, was rlly unique though. My first taste made me think of oranges for some reason. There's tanginess, sourness, and a little bit of heat, but what it completely lacks in umami it makes up for in fruitiness, though not in the traditional sweet sense. As it goes well with the kway teow be sure to opt for the non spicy version and add the sambal yourself(instead of the usual chili paste that ckt is Fried with) "

Rice was average but well seasoned which im a Fan of. The chili though, while lacking in complexity, makes up for it in explosiveness. Strong ginger and garlic, as well as spiciness and sourness would have made me regret if i added any more of it. The worst part is that the heat lingers so take heed. The ginger paste on the other hand was rlly fresh and i enjoyed it a lot. As did the cabbage soup which was flavourful and has ethereal slices of cabbage floating around"

Special mention goes to the chicken, which we all know can get tough and chalky if overcooked; here, even the breast meat was delightfully tender.\nThere are two varieties for each meat stew – a non-spicy soy sauce base and a spicy gochujang (red pepper paste) one that is further customisable with 4 levels of spice. But regardless of whichever stew base you choose, the meat itself is absolutely delicious, reeking of a marinade in which it's soaked overnight for guaranteed flavour.\nI could go on about the DIY mixed grain rice balls – I still can't decide whether I love the anchovy or tuna better! – but I'll leave that for another time. Also, the crispy-chewy Korean pancakes are a MUST-TRY, with not-so-traditional flavours like potato and tomato & cheeeeeeeeese.\nOkay, now please excuse me while I wipe the drool off my face."

Must say it is more pricey as compared to the other claypot stalls I frequent (aljunied coffeeshop small portion is $6. Chiak claypot rice is $5+)! But they gave alottt of chicken meat slices! It was the rice portion that was lesser than usual (or perhaps because most of it was stuck on my claypot bottom and I didn't like to scrap out chaotah rice to eat). Both the chilli provided went very well with the claypot chicken rice! The sambal given was the sweet kind, while i took the wanton mee spicy chilli sauce to add more kick to the meal!

We enjoyed what we had, grilled prawn, crab croquettes and especially the grilled octopus that was on point.\nWe picked their spiced glazed pork belly which was spectacular and yummy good, flavourful and great meat-fats proportions that was pleasant to enjoy.\nThere were more appealing sounding items on their mains, pasta and risotto list for a sumptuous meal. Similarly for their appetisers that we liked. But we were glad we saved space for dessert as the red wine poached pear we had was really memorable to end with.\nWe would recommend to wine and dine here after having some of their cocktails and absolutely loving them. Have a little chat with Mr Star who may concoct some special mix in your drinks if you’re not going for the wine.\nThe interior of @mpiresingapore was chic and cosy, for a formal date or comfortable gathering.

Our prawns were pretty big but we couldn’t find those umami roe in the heads that we loved, although the meat was still good. The pork ribs were disappointing. Not the tender juicy meat and they tasted separate from the prawn mee itself.\nSo we later learnt that Xing Ji relocated from Suntec.

They do have noodle alternative too.\nBut a meal here should not stop with just their chicken rice. And their Thai steamed fish would be a must-try, with that kick-ass sour and spicy sauce on a fresh sea bass that we had.\nIn addition, we had their Chai Po omelette, braised pork belly and curry Chap Chye which were also delicious and completed our satisfying meal. We just loved the various sauces that came with different dishes.\nNo doubt we do have good chicken rice places of our own, but this is also one good chicken rice worthy of mention. Located at 5 malls around the island, it will be one stop for a good and sumptuous Thai style chicken rice meal."

The thin slices of Wagyu were fatty but lacked the grill finishing which was a real pity.\nIronically, we enjoyed their salad bar and egg station more than the mains. The former offered quite a substantial range for salad mix. Their free-flow tamago was the best thing for the meal; but it wouldn’t make sense to come and pay to mainly enjoy that. Unfortunately, the tamago was the only thing we remembered after the meal."

And this was just perfect with my iced latte.\nNot regrets with the extra calories on their coconut pineapple cake as the taste came through distinctly. The cake was also pleasantly soft and moist.\nAnother good weekend brunch place and we would return soon for their savoury items, and also for their interesting range of drinks."

Their lamb chops are so well seasoned and chargrilled that there is zero game and the meat breaks away. Labanese cuisine is also known for their kofta and mashwi which a mixed platter would be ideal to try them all. Whereas Mezza Platter ($31.50) allows you to try their appetising dips such as grilled eggplant with herbs and chickpea which is surprisingly good. To think all the flavours of the dishes complemented well and dont clash, i give it to the chef. And no labanese meal is complete without Laban Aryan drinks made from fresh yogurt and recommended to have fruity flavoured ones for beginners ($8.90). We prefer their Strawberry Ayran. An idea for your sundate or gatherings along 14 Bussorah Street."

The chef, Ah Tan, serves a delicious plate of FKT which he learned to cook it right from his father who ran the same name stall in a coffee shop in Armenian Street. Almost every string of mee and kway teow is covered with egg which make it tasty to bite. There’s the juicy see hum (cockles), slices of fish cake and slices of quality Chinese sausage fried just right to complement the whole dish. Wok hee is good and the FTK is not too wet nor dry. What I love about it is that it’s not too sweet nor salty. The dish I had was $3 with a $1 worth of cockles. It’s really yummy delicious. Stall is closed every Thursdays. Opens from about 11 am till sold out before dinner."

It honestly doesn't look like much, but it tastes pretty good. The scrambled eggs are creamy & slightly runny, just the way I like them. I just admit that the sausage gives the dish saltiness in good proportion. The sliced sourdough bread was impressively toasted to perfection!

The skin is on the thick side, which I'm not so used to.. Especially for the XLBs where I prefer the skin thinner.\nBut this made for a decent meal. The chives in the dumplings added good flavour, & the soup in the XLBs was delicious. I would eat these again.\nPlus points for self service ginger & vinegar - I always load up on the ginger, with minimal vinegar. & yet another one: This stall accepts GrabPay, so yay for cashless transactions & earning Grab points! \nMade my way home with frozen goodies in tow: Xiao Long Baos 小笼包 go for $10 a bag of 20 pieces, Dumplings 水饺 at $12 for a bag of 30 pieces."

What made it extra awesome was that this muffin cake fresh out of the oven and we devoured it while it was still warm! So good! It was moist and soft, with lots of gooey Nutella and chunks of banana.

I preferred the chicken cutlet over the fried chicken, and the omelette over the sunny side up, but both were good options! I love how tender both chicken options were, the batter was crisp and not too thick. Choose the cutlet if you’re lazy like me 😂 the rice was fragrant enough, but not particularly outstanding. As for the sambal, it was well-balanced, slightly sweet and not very spicy - so everyone can enjoy it. \nI’d rate this as above average nasi lemak. It’s not the best in Singapore, but they don’t claim to specialise in any dish in particular, and the main draw of Cafe Pandan is their variety of delicious local dishes and comfortable interior. Definitely a nice place to consider if you’re looking for local food in a cafe setting instead of a hawker center or coffee shop."

Pricier than a regular coffee shop or kopitiam, but still much cheaper than going out for breakfast at a cafe.\nThe yuan yang here isn’t too sweet, plus the ratio of coffee to tea and milk is just right such that none of the components overshadow the others. Not sure if the cafe has ties to Tiong Bahru Pau which is just a few shop units down, but I’m sure I’ll be coming back again :)"

They’ve completely blown Tong Ah out of the water as my favourite Kaya toast place from now on.\nThey offer two kinds of toast - traditional (pictured) or thick toast. As you can see, even the traditional toast is super thick despite it being toasted. The toast retains a very fluffy and soft texture on the inside, and it was pure pleasure to eat - almost as though I was having crispy toast with steamed bread inside. The Kaya isn’t overly sweet either, and they were quite generous with the fillings. Try their toast for sure!"

I especially enjoyed the grilled chicken because it was simple and yet so good 😋⁣\n⁣\nThank you @anticsatplay for the invite and @korkaisg for feeding us! 😊"

Tasted very similar to Joel Robuchon’s famed mashed potatoes, god how have we lost a legend in the culinary world.

The chicken cutlet was tender and succulent and not covered in too much batter like what we would normally get elsewhere. The smoked duck was so juicy and fresh damn. 2) It may not look like a lot, but I was really full after finishing it. Very value for money! Only wished that the sauce on the rice would be less spicy/peppery (tasted like some spicy bbq sauce) as it almost overpowered the taste of the meats, there was just too many flavours in this bowl, plain rice would be better! Nevertheless this was still GOLD. Simple and good. "

With long beans and kaffir lime leaves. Such a simple dish yet the blend of flavours was just perfect. Not spicy but equally as tasty!\n*\n@sk_food_and_travel had been raving about this restaurant non stop since his Thai cousin brought him here during his last visit to Bangkok. I can totally understand why. This was easily the best meal we had in Bangkok. Well suited to our Malaysian palates. Apparently the Thai royal family was a big fan of the owner’s cooking.\n*\nDefinitely pay them a visit if you are in Bangkok.

In fact, I was impressed and decided immediately that this has got to to be one of the flavours for my cup of 🍨. The roasted, smoky flavour along with a lingering subtle earthy and vegetal bitter undertone was a delight to my palate ; fans of Goma/Shirogoma would most probably fancy this flavour as well, with its prominent, aromatic roasted flavour. @tomspalettesg please please consider having this as a permanent flavour! 🙏🏻🙏🏻 Another flavour which I had chosen is the Tieguanyin milk tea, which is actually Monday’s special flavour but the portion left seems to differ otherwise, with only a meagre amount left in the whole tub. Love how the tea flavour is distinct here, with a lingering aroma that overwhelms its milky partner in crime. If you are one who prefers having milk tea which is less milky (like me🤭), this flavour is the definitely one for you! 👍🏻 .\n.\n[PS: Heard that there is Pipagao flavour on Wednesday which I am certainly keen to try after a positive experience with Wobbee’s pipagao milk tea 😋.

A total of 5 different soufflé pancake flavours are offered here (swipe to the end to view the menu), ranging from classic original to fruit-based ones such as strawberry and mango passionfruit. We settled for the Oolong flavour instead, which was more uncommon and less mainstream. Served with gula melaka boba pearls, chantilly cream, a side of Oolong créme anglaise is also served alongside the stack of 2 fluffy soufflé pancakes. The soufflé pancakes are freshly baked upon order which required a waiting time of at least 15 minutes. Texture was soft, fluffy and cotton-like, with a subtle eggy flavour. Not as eggy as @rizlabosg though my dining partner mentioned that it’s more eggy than Gram which I have yet got to try. Though this is not the best soufflé pancakes I’ve had, it was still pretty enjoyable and given it’s affordable pricing, I wouldn’t mind a revisit for other flavours. Imo the highlight here has got to be the Oolong créme anglaise which possessed a distinct, lingering aroma of Oolong tea flavour, great for the bubble tea / milk tea lovers! 💛 The side of chantilly cream was also smooth, creamy with a pleasant tinge of sweetness that came not only as an enhancement to the visuals but rather a palatable complement to the fluffy stack🥞.\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #fluffstack #sgfoodie #sgdesserts"

Usually not a fan of plain milk flavoured softserve but the one here turned me into a convert instantly, with its aromatic dairy flavour coupled with a smooth, creamy texture. Note that the softserve might be a tad rich for the faint-hearted; though the portion might seem to be not a lot, it was actually pretty filling- warning first, do not get this after a heavy meal! 🚫 On the other hand, the melonpan was equally satisfying, which surpassed my expectation for a typical ‘street food’. Never would I expect a simple looking bun to taste that great, and this came with a crisp, caramelised golden brown crust on its exterior along with a soft, fluffy and pillow interior that comes with an optional softserve (vanilla/matcha) sandwiches within.

Love how the houjicha cream came with a distinct, aromatic lingering roasted fragrance that was subtle yet pleasant to the palate. Cake roll was a little dry for my liking when eaten in silo, but the substantial amount of smooth houjicha cream was a good complement and compensation for that! 👍🏻 The matcha chocolate was served with 2 slices by default but the staff was really kind to offer a slice to me on the house as she mentioned that one of the slice wasn’t slice to perfection and hence she would not wish to serve it (kudos to such awesome service in Japan where presentation plays a significant role to customer satisfaction! 👍🏻💯). Comprising of a fluffy chocolate sponge beneath smooth, luscious matcha cream and a top layer of matcha chocolate ganache, the matcha flavour here is rather subtle, which might not be an ideal one for hardcore matchaholics. Fortunately it was not too sweet or milky and I am still impressed with how light & smooth the matcha cream is, couple with the soft, fluffy chocolate sponge that makes it a perfect, easy-on-the-waistline teatime treat! 💚 Also exclusive to the take-home confection here is the Matcha cream Daifuku (yasss to NO RED BEANS), comprising of a thin layer of chewy mochi skin enveloping a core of smooth, creamy and thick matcha paste fillings and fresh cream. Though the matcha flavour wasn’t really intense as I had expected it to be, there was no cloying factor (perhaps due to the absence of azuki as well 😉) which I certainly enjoyed! 😋"

However, this was still one of the better ones I’ve had, ranking #2 in my 💚, and especially one that’s bound to satisfy hardcore matchaholics. Encased within the firm, crisp tart crust lies a thin bottom layer of unsweetened black sesame feuillitine along with matcha ganache, and lastly topped with a kawaii matcha bavaroise “paw” that came with a pleasant surprise of Okinawa black sugar core within 🤩. Matchaholics be warned! Though the matcha ganache here isn’t as potent as the one from Be my guest, the earthy flavour and astringency was prominent, with a lingering bitter undertone which makes every bite a blissful addiction for me 💚. Personally an anti-black sesame, hence I wasn’t a fan of the black sesame feuillitine that contributed to a hint of roasted, charred and woody flavour profile to the earthy matcha element. The pudding-alike matcha bavaroise was creamy, luscious with a subtle earthy flavour (not as robust as the matcha ganache of course), along with thin layer of Okinawa black sugar sandwiched within that provided a pleasant tinge of sweetness. Simply adore the crisp tart shell as well that withheld an aromatic buttery fragrance, though I personally feel it would be better if the matcha ganache filling within could have been slightly thicker to achieve a well-balanced ratio of pastry tart: filling .\n.\n[PS: This tart is currently unavailable for purchase but do keep a look out @dairyandcream for future online\nbake sales! ✨ On a side note, I am also secretly wishing if there could be other flavours of tarts in the near future, perhaps a Houjicha one? 🤓] .\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #dairyandcream #sgfoodie"

The cookie butter flavour here was surprisingly distinct and not cloying in the smooth , creamy frozen yogurt, with its sweet caramelised flavour blending in harmoniously with the tangy, sour yogurt base. Fans of cookie butter like me can also opt for the cookie sauce to go along with your cup of froyo, which helps to enhance and intensify the Speculoos flavour profile. The Sanum now comes with your choice of 2 sauces instead of 1, though I opt for both to be the cookie sauce 🤭. Along with 3 fruits and 2 crunch of your choice, I was rather disappointed that it was served with an inproportionate balance of froyo:toppings, to which I was struggling to finish the fruits and crunches since the 30% of froyo here could be gone in a few mouthfuls. Also due to this reason I decided to order another cup of petit mini sized froyo as an accompaniment to the remaining toppings in the Sanum. Even though the original flavour of frozen yogurt here is good enough, I certainly hope that the caramelised cookie froyo can remain as a permanent flavour here ! 🙏🏻 .\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #llallaosg #sgfoodie"

                "Review": ".\nOngoing Summer fair @isetansg Scotts till 11 July! ✨The sweet potato pie comes in an option of original yellow or purple, which I opted for the latter. The pastry crust is flaky with a caramelised golden brown exterior, with a substantial interior of creamy, thick purple sweet potato filling that withheld a pleasant, subtle tinge of natural sweetness. On the other hand, the cheesecakes paled in comparison, with the crumble base lacking a characteristic buttery fragrance and felt as though it had been stored for quite some time. In short, it didn’t feel fresh and the texture was thick,dense and creamy which might not suited for the faint-hearted. The purple potato flavour came with tiny chunks of purple potato embedded within, while the cheesecake itself was infused with a purple potato flavour. Despite the vibrant lavender-alike purplish hues that provided an aesthetically appealing outlook, the flavour was subtle and barely detectable, masked by the tangy, piquant note of cream cheese. While the earl grey cheesecake did carry off distinct subtle notes of tea flavour on the first few bites, it was unfortunate (and perhaps inevitable) that it faded off almost instantly, overwhelmed by the stronger cheese element. //\nOn a side note, the lacklustre service here added even more salt to my ‘wound’, with unfriendly stares from the staff if you were to sample and not purchase anything here. Also, when I requested for a box and ice gel pack for my purchase, the staff reluctantly gave in and seemed displeased with her impolite tone and unfriendly gestures .\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #sgfoodie #isetansg"

There’s also cheese slices atop the ramyeon noodles which had unfortunately dissolved into the piping hot stew and hence not visible or detectable for the sight and senses anymore. Perhaps this might seem like a mess of assorted ingredients swimming in an orange pool but never judge a book by its cover - it was certainly a messy but yummy affair! 👍🏻 From the savoury preserved meat (my favourite element in army stew always 💖), soft tofu to chewy rice cakes, every single element here was a good complement to the stew. What’s more, there’s also free flow of mini hash brown balls that were deep fried to an ideal crisp perfection on its golden brown exterior , along with kimchi and pickles, white rice and also complimentary soda beverages for all diners ! 🍻 Such a steal at this pocket-friendly pricing and abundant portion that left me with a bloated albeit satisfied stomach thereafter 😋. Definitely revisiting this eatery the next time I head back to Seoul! 💯 .\n.\n[PS: No geogtag for this restaurant, do refer to the last photo here for its store l name ‘준호네 부대찌개” ; situated a stone’s throw away from Anam station] .\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #armystew #koreanarmystew #sgfoodie"

All ice cream and bakes here are vegan-friendly, which are made using coconut / almond milk instead of the usual cow’s milk. The keto chocolate sorbet (sugar-free) as featured here is made using 100% coco powder, with xylitol sweetener as an alternative to sugar. The end result is one that came with a bittersweet flavour profile, thick and chocolatey, along with a softer texture that’s more prone to melting and hence it’s advisable to consume it in a cup instead of cone. Hardcore chocoholics would love this for it’s intense cocoa flavour that was divine , indulgent albeit imparting a sorethroat-inducing fear factor to me 🤭. On the other hand, the chunky peanut butter cheesecake cake came with a smooth, creamy texture in the coconut milk based ‘cheese’, a slight chunky mouthfeel from the nuts embedded within, coupled with a nutty, gritty base that’s made with walnuts, cashews and dates. The presence of peanut ‘butter’ came as swirls embedded within the luscious, creamy ‘cheese’cake component, contributing to a a subtle tinge of saltiness. Personally felt that it would have been better if the peanut butter flavour was stronger and more distinct as the coconut flavour seemed to have stolen the limelight from all the other elements here. Nevertheless, it was still not too bad and worth a try if you are craving for cheesecakes but wish to indulge with a lower level of guilt .\n.\n.\n.\n#burpple #kindkonessg #kindkones #sgfoodie #sgdessert #vegandessert #veganfoodsg"

Topped with a bittersweet dark chocolate coating and chocolate cookies crumbles, this decadent, sore-throat inducing chocolatey goodness is highly recommended for sharing unless you are a hardcore chocoholic.

The cupcake was soft, fluffy and sufficiently moist, with the dark chocolate fudge core adding a bittersweet flavour profile. On the downside, the frosting was a tad too sweet for my liking, with a cloying saccharine factor that caused me to omit it after two small spoonfuls. Personally I would prefer the brownie over this, though this cupcake might be a safer option for a solo indulgence. .\n.\n#burpple #plainvanillabakery #sgfoodie"

Sad to admit that this might not meet up to the expectations of hardcore matchaholics, with the freshly whisked matcha being overshadowed by its pink companion when the layers are incorporated together as a a whole. The characteristic earthy flavour and vegetal, bitter undertone became a secondary flavour profile to the tangy, fruity and subtle floral notes of the pink elements.

A cakey texture that’s dense and crumbly, the top coating of matcha cream cheese was also something that might not appeal to hardcore matchaholics, leaning towards the sweet side that lacks earthiness.

Terrible experience here on many counts. 1) the price they charged was the more expensive “wastage” price even though we finished all the food. With the mandatory drink order, the total bill added up to pretty much the same price as if we had ordered all ala carte, but we didn’t get to have the salad bar etc too. 2) They likely forgot our order of takoyaki until we reminded them because it took so long to arrive. When it finally did, the interior of the takoyaki was cold - obviously not cooked properly. When we told the service staff, his reply was “I don’t know, it’s prepared by the kitchen.” Wow, what “great” service recovery. Even when they replaced the items, they FORGOT part of the order again!!!! 3) Many items on the menu weren’t available - truffle items weren’t available BUT they said we could order the truffle salmon udon from another section of the menu. Sounds contradictory? The solution was that the truffle salmon udon had NO TRUFFLE in it -.- 4) Food portions are tiny, especially the amount (or lack) of meat. 5) Wasabi costs $3 - I didn’t bother to order it to find out how the portion is like 6) They insisted on cancelling my Chope reservation because I was using a Burpple deal."

I will say that it's really some sort of wagyu as the meat is fairly tender and umami compared to the usual hard and dry astons steak.\n.\n💡 : Be prepared for the typical Aston set up with the annoying and inefficient bottleneck at the entrance (order and pay first before getting seated) since NO ONE can decide on their order.

I do like my food cold or at room temp, but I found the dipping sauce rather salty, with no taste of spice or yuzu. I much preferred the spicy yuzu soup ramen that I had last week with its thinner noodles and clear but tasty broth.\n.\n💡: you MUST like the tangy citrus taste of yuzu to appreciate their signature soup base. It's not the typical tonkotsu ramen shop you find in SG offering pork based soup with rich mouthfeel.\n💡💡: chilli lovers should avoid this place. They do not have any chilli condiments (no oil, pepper or cut chilli) and the spicy versions of their ramen (both dry and soup) are not spicy at all. "

While being super flavourful with just the right punch if spiciness, the beef was tough and chewy. I'd recommend to stick with the pork instead which was more tender.\nAlthough i liked the food in general, prices here are indeed on the higher end, and i wouldn't dare say that it would have been worth it without burpple beyond"

The crunchy crispies are just fragrant enough and who’s to say no when you can bury your chicken in scoops of it? The golden batter bits elevate your meal with every munch. The chicken rice is a game changer, making an aromatic pairing with your chicken so you get a moreish meal. The deep-fried chicken thigh is tender meat wrapped in crunchy skin. It's marinated till saltish which enhances its savouriness. Slapped onto the side is some spicy sambal balado chilli sauce which imparts a tinge of sourness. A bit of it burns your whole palate without being overly potent. I like myself a Milo Dinosaur from the drinks stall a few units down to finish.\n.\nFull review: https://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/Aspirasi"

Toss the noodles well so you get their deliciously sweet binding sauce with every bite. The char siew slices have caramelized flavour, while the kailan adds crunch, and the braised mushrooms lend some earthiness. Slap on some sweet chilli paste to mix but the meal is moreish to me even without.

The egg yolk oozes slightly and the crunchy cucumber slices go well with the sweet and spicy sambal chilli that champions it all. It burns in the back of your throat and is so lovely I sometimes have it on it’s own. Juicy is the chicken wing in its crunchy skin, tasting savoury from its marinade. Add-on begedil ($0.50) or otah ($1.50) for a fuller meal!\n.\nRead more: http://bit.do/Boon-Lay-Power-Nasi-Lemak"

The mound of rice is fragrant with enough chicken stock for flavour and the meal is good even without chilli but I must have their freshly chopped ginger which is watery. But before all that, what’s a super appetising start to the meal is a sip of their savoury soup that's highlighted by chopped spring onions. Finish this meal with a drink from Whompoa Soya Bean.

It has dark sauce underneath and is topped with chunky apple chutney, a peeled cherry tomato, eggplant pesto mashed potato, and finished with a tuile. Dollops of pesto mayo sauce, squares of purple beets, and thin slices of radish surround it.\n.\nI smelled this one before I saw it. The meaty chunk is quite lean with a strong flavour, making it a heavy meal. It's chewy without being overdone and tough. Give a thumbs up to the pesto flavour in the mashed potato and the soft, crunchy mushrooms and zucchini underneath. The house-made sauce is interesting to figure out and thick sweet black sauce — like the one in fried carrot cake — was one of its ingredients."

Ah Huat (the stall owner) praised me because he said 要吃就吃好的 👌🏼 and he told me about the big and hugely satisfying dinner he had the day before.\n.\nSlurp up the soupy curry which is not fierce and let it coat your tongue with its tinge of sweetness and coconut flavour. It's slightly grainy with grounded spices and savoury from its chicken stock. The potatoes are soft to bite into and tasty from being infused with the lemak gravy. Spongey tau pok slices make mini explosions in your mouth. Their poached chicken chunks are so tender and silky I had no regrets with spending extra.

The soup is thick and smooth —what I’d best describe as liquified red bean bao filling which, incidentally, is my go-to comfort food on a budget.

Their 不见天 char siew is a cut from the pig's armpit that's roasted till it exudes distinct BBQ smokiness. The slices are tender with a layer of fats that wrap around the chewy and lean portions. The rice, heavily drenched in black goo, is mildly sweetish and pairs deliciously with dollops of their chilli paste that's slightly spicy.

It’s served with a wedge of potato and carrot plus onions that are stewed till soft. The thick sauce is like the usual Japanese curry, but smoother and creamier with less spiciness and more pepperiness. It doesn’t strike as being distinctly different but it being refillable is a definite draw. Rice is refillable too.\n.\nThe crispy breading of the katsu is crunchy, light, and not greasy. The meat is rather succulent and a tad chewy. I strongly encourage you to help yourself to their yakitori sauce that’s on every table because it enhances your meat with a salty-sweet barbeque flavour.\n.\nFull review: https://herecomesgin.wixsite.com/ginwashere/single-post/Tengawa-Hokkaido-White-Curry"

Besides choux, they have bite size brownies and sliced cheesecakes too . Not a brownie fan but my other half likes it :) we are also a fan of their cheesecakes ! Swipe to see two other flavours - susu manis and oops I forgot the other 😅 Chou pastries are 3 for $10 or $3.50 each .\nHonestly would want to keep this place a secret 😂😅 as they are usually sold out everyday of the choux pastries. #EileeneatsBedok #shubbysweets\npls don’t buy all ..leave some for me 🤣"

Even though I did not get to pick up the burger with my hands because the bottom bun was already a little soggy, I was enjoying some theatrical effect of the patty bursting some jus from some knifework.\nThe waiter explained that this burger was an improved version from its initial appearance, as customers had given feedback previously that the patty was too dry. Well, I would just say that the “dryness” was acceptable since it was turkey meat that we were talking about. Any juicier or fatter would only imply that the meat was not lean, wasn’t it?\nPaying an extra S$3.00 to this S$23.00 dish was a great decision made. Not that I did not like their fries, but their four pieces of onion rings was literally a big deal. Having coated with batter that did not soften, it felt like eating some onion cookies that tasted good but did not appear to be an overload of calories."

Firstly, the sauce that was layered atop the grilled chicken was thick with a rich nutty flavour and mildly spicy. Secondly, familiar ingredients such as the diced cucumber and raw onion rings helped in balancing the Satay flavours, just like what we would have in their skewered forms (thankfully, no Ketupats here!). Lastly, the usual sidekicks — fries and coleslaw — helped remind me that this was still a Western meal, with the coleslaw especially maintaining its usual creamy consistency.

Be prepared to break open the cup cover to retrieve the choc if you would wish to eat it. Not only that, but the beverage had also reflected a lack of novelty, given that this was probably the third drink within the year that used green tea and chocolate as the main ingredient.\nAfter trying this drink, I thought I could have gotten more satisfaction from a Green Tea Frappuccino with added Java Chip for a self-proclaimed better combo."

Beneath Oscar’s “head”, the garden salad lined the base of the trash bin (now, wasn’t that inappropriate?). Burgers were never complete without fries, and thus the crispy curly fries was there to fill the plate, though I also wished they could give more fries as shown in the menu. In terms of the taste, I would say that the savoury profile of the teriyaki Katsu was well-balanced against the sweet-ish Mantou which tasted quite fresh as well, so I was indeed pleased with this order.\nSome of the food items and merchandise seemed to have run out during the visit, so I would think that one should visit Kumoya early to experience this theme before more goodies got out of stock and more plushies got stained or soiled by mishandling."

Given a price of S$9.50, there were nine blocks of toast that were stacked together, and the ice cream was just a temperature contrast to the dessert.\nWhat I fancied about this dish though, was the toast were done to a point whereby the exterior was done to a slight crisp, whereas the internal part of them was still quite fluffy. Whether the condensed milk was drizzled or dipped, the French Toast maintained a balance of sweet and savoury flavours altogether.\nAnyway, there were traces of crushed pistachio from the plating, so just watch out for any potential food allergies that might surface."

                "Review": "Braised pork softbone was something that one might find from some Japanese ramen and Taiwanese cuisine, but having it with fish soup was a different experience altogether. This S$9.50 dish was more like having sliced fish bee hoon, less the sliced ginger and fresh fish, but with lots of pork meat and collagen as a substitute.\nBecause the meat was braised and the gravy came with it, one could hardly tell the flavour of the soup from the colour. However, I literally emptied the bowl because everything in it could be swallowed. The bowl was slightly bigger than their normal soup bowls, so the portion was sufficiently filling especially if there were some starters or side orders to share.\nAnd I realised, Mixian (米線) referred to thick Bee Hoon."

Loved the clams, though slightly small, they were fresh and sweet. Best part about the meal was the super tasty homemade chili soy sauce they serve, packed with coriander, spring onions, ginger, garlic and more herbs and spices. Total damage for two: $56.

When we first arrived at 6.45pm on a Saturday, we were shocked to see that there was only 1 table occupied! Nevertheless we gave it a shot, and I had this bowl of ramen, which was one of the very few non-spicy options on the menu.\nThe Mentaiko roe was alright, not too overpowering. In fact the Tonkotsu base was strong, although a bit too oily. The chicken slices were tender and I like that they were quite generous with the ingredients in the bowl. Overall, I guess you can't compare to the ramen specialty stores, but still worth a try if in the area."

The nasi lemak is a steal as $6.50 gets the full works of ingredients including ikan bilis, peanuts, runny egg, cucumber, sambal, and a choice between rendang, har cheong and grilled chicken. I went with the har cheong, which had a very light and crispy crust and juicy flesh. Another fantastic part about this place is the drinks menu. A butterfly pea brown sugar soy milk costs just $2. Do note that the nasi lemak is only available on mon, wed and fri."

TLW specializes in herbal roast duck prepared with dang gui. Amongst the meats we sampled, all the roast were above average though I prefer my roast duck with a stronger herbal flavour. The char siew was nicely charred but could be sliced thicker for a stronger flavour. The stall sells out after lunch and is quite a popular spot for the folks in the neighbourhood.\n.\nThank you @alhsx for the invitation and @jthejon for the hospitality."

I went with the premium bowl because why not but they also have the usual $12.80 (vegetables) and $14.80 (prawns + veg) bowls that are great to order too. Every piece of ingredient is not overfried and they serve just enough rice to complement the ingredients. My favourite pieces were the anago, fish and lava egg.

We ordered countless trays of the short rib as it was the juiciest amongst all the meats available. Aside from wagyu, other notables were the salmon and swordfish sashimi, the iberico pork collar and the plethora of fresh seafood.

Although it’s currently $80/pax, with #burpplebeyond , that’s the price for 2 so it’s really worth the price point!\n.\nWe began with 2 starters and a beef bone consumé. Had a hard time picking out my fave as they were all delicious, especially the financier slathered with foie gras mousse. The next course of short rib served with potato pavé was a great prelude for the main course although I did find that the dish had a tad too much of a salt bae moment. My favourite dish is definitely the char siew served with a bah kwa sandwich. Both elements were excellent. Char siew had a nice texture and was suitably caramelized while the bread used for the bah kwa sandwich was served warm and lightly toasted. The main was a hearty portion of tri tip. The final dessert course also wowed me with a pistachio mousse served with cheery and meringue. The pistachio cream was extremely smooth and wasn’t overly sweet.\n.\nThank you @fatbellysg for hosting the meal and @burpple for extending the invitation."

                "Review": "5 Senses Bistro has quietly updated & overhauled its menu since the last time I’ve been there. One of the new dishes on the menu is this White Seafood Crabmeat Pasta ($14.90++), which sees crab meat (duh), squid, shrimp & mussels stewing in a wonderful white seafood soup.\nApparently, 5 Senses takes the old adage that ‘you eat with your eyes first’ very seriously, as they serve this piquant pasta in a cute ceramic crab bowl. It is a little annoying to get all that brilliant broth out with all the tiny nooks inside the bowl, but there’s no denying that the presentation is bang-on beautiful.\n5 Senses has always been a stellar soup maker even though they don’t specialise in soups, and their white seafood soup is utterly umami. It’s rich, briny, wondrously wholesome, and is undoubtedly hearty. The angel hair pasta is competently cooked to al dente perfection and absorbs that sapid soup well.\nThe seafood was pleasantly fresh, with the mussels tasting nice and clean and the crab with just a little hint of sweetness in it. The weird thing about squid is that it must be cooked just right, or it must be thoroughly overcooked in order to qualify as perfectly cooked squid. 5 Senses’ squid is definitely at the latter end, with the squid being soft and easy to bite into, with just a little bit of resistance and snap. The shrimp within ain’t much, but they’re fresh, slightly sweet & satisfyingly snappy.\nBelieve me folks, 5 Senses’ White Seafood Crabmeat Pasta is a tremendous treat for all 5 senses. No bullcrab here, only honest to goodness seafood soup."

But is it really worth it to head so far out of the way just for this?\nIf you live in Sengkang, Punggol or Hougang, then perhaps. The beef rendang is undoubtedly the best thing about this dish, as the beef brisket was fully infused with the scintillating spices in the rempah that the brisket was marinated in, and the redolent rempah is a real delight for the nose & tongue. The beef was kind of dry and wasn’t as tender as expected, but then again they did chuck it into a broiler to melt all that cheese.\nIt was also charmingly cheesy, yes, ‘twas cheesier than my drunk pick up lines. I just wish that they poured on more of that ravishing rendang onto the rice and all over the melted cheese after baking the dish, as the current state of the dish is a touch too dry.\nNevertheless, it’s still a beefy, ren-dang brilliant dish."

I’m gonna be honest with ya, it’s nothing special, nor is it memorably magnificent. It was decent. Yeah, it was decent.\nThe soft shell crab was nicely fried and didn’t carry around too much excess oil, and it was rather meaty, which was certainly a nice surprise. However, what really made this burger great was the wasabi mayonnaise. The dollop of wasabi mayo on it was a serious, no bullcrab and absolutely kickass mayo mix. It had a very feisty kick of wasabi, mixed with the creamy addictiveness of mayonnaise. The only problem I had with it was the notable lack of it on the burger. MORE!"

Marinated in a truly sapid spice mix before being charcoal grilled to juicy, meaty succulence, it was a downright delicious cock. The smokiness accented the savoury spice mix superbly, and the chicken was quite possibly the P H A T T E S T chicken satay ever.\nThe peanut sauce on the side is subtly sweet, subtly spicy and satisfyingly salty while being lusciously thick. In other words, it’s perfect as lube for the cock. Shoot, it could easily smack a good few satay hawkers out of business, that’s how good it is.\nThe surprise were definitely the sweet pork skewers ($2.80++ a pop), which actually managed to outshine the stellar satay. Marinated in Thai spices & honey, these tender, fatty chunks of porcine were positively palate pleasing. A little saltiness, a little stickiness, a little sweetness, a little spice & everything nice, and these porkers went down a treat.\nLe Coq aren’t just one dimensional cock purveyors, their porkers are absolute mint too."

This bowl of California Maki Dip is priced at $12++, but most of the ingredients that go into it is pretty cheap. That’s one helluva profit margin right there. So, why would anyone fork out $12++ for a dish that costs relatively little to make?\nIt’s quite possibly the most addictive snack to ever cross your lips, and once you start eating it, you can’t stop. Yes, it’s just crabstick, cucumber, tamago (egg) & possibly avocado tossed in mayonnaise, but it’s inexplicably addictive. It’s creamy yet light, and sweet yet sufficiently savoury at the same time. Just like revenge & sake, it’s best served cold. The rice crisps on the side are pure brilliance, as they add more saltiness & a very charming crunch to the whole affair.\nYeah, it’s $12++ for the filling in a California roll, but there’s no bullcrab going on here. It’s all legitimately delicious business."

The Guilty Pleasure bowl, which sets you back at a rate of $88++ a pop, is an off menu bowl that sees Japanese wagyu striploin in place of its Aussie counterpart, which is in the Kabuke Pleasure Bowl ($58++).\nWhile the Japanese Kagoshima Wagyu striploin was certainly tender and adequately fatty, it was a little underwhelming as I felt that it could’ve been more well salted to turn the beefy, fatty flavours up to 11. However, I’m dead certain that the beef has been perfumed with truffle, as the unmistakable aroma of it was insistent & strong. \nThe foie gras might just be one of the best I’ve had thus far. It was cooked just right, and it melted in my mouth just like butter. The seasoning was stellar, with the unknown glaze coating the foie gras being sweet, sticky & unforgettably umami in all the right amounts. The little dollop of uni was ludicrously creamy and beautifully briny, giving a little taste of the ocean it was fished out from.\nThe rice, while simple, was superbly steamed and served its role as a warm, wholesome comforting backdrop to the rest of the carnal pleasures that adorned this very, very, pleasurable bowl. The onsen egg was overcooked, but it managed to serve its purpose of lubricating the grains of rice sufficiently enough for easier ingestion.\nSatisfaction? Most definitely.\nPleasure? All of it.\nGuilt. None of it.\nHotel? Trivago."

Those spuds were fortified with cheese that made the mash tremendously thick and ridiculously ravishing, and we couldn’t get enough of those pounded spuds.\nIf you’re tired of cocks, Le Coq’s knuckle might be able to satisfy you.

Leave your drink in the hands of co-owner and veteran bartender KC's capable hands, and let him surprise you with a bespoke cocktail (price varies). Food wise, the hearty fare reflects Singaporean chef-owner Justin Foo's Asian roots. The skewers (from $4) bring the limelight to familiar flavours, as seen in the Chicken Thigh ($5) marinated in yellow curry, lemongrass and kaffir lime, and Beef Sirloin ($9) marinated in kecap manis and oolong tea. To really line the tummy though, go for the selection of claypot rice. The Mushroom Tea Rice ($9) keeps it simple but great with smoky oolong, shiitake and egg, or go luxe with the Oyster & Uni Rice ($28).\nAvg Price: $40 per person\nPhoto by Burpple Tastemaker Cassie Ong"

The walls are covered with newspaper clippings of Peranakan Flavours's famed dish — Bakwan Kepiting ($10), a minced meatball and crabmeat soup, and the space is big enough to accommodate large groups, making this place ideal for company lunches or family dinners. Swing by with your colleagues during lunch for their value-for-money sets. Prices start from $8.80 for Nonya Curry Chicken and Babi Pongtey (stewed pork with fermented soy bean), and $10.80 for dishes like Chicken Buah Keluak and Assam Pedas Fish. Each set meal comes with a choice of rice (with pickles and curry vegetables on the side), noodles or bread. The Burpple community loves the House Special Laksa Goreng ($15) — a dry version of the iconic dish that features \"noodles that are coated with thick rempah that packs a spicy umami punch\", according to Burppler Weekendeatwhat. Don't leave without sharing a bowl of their house made Pulot Hitam ($5); it's thick, not overly sweet and just the way we like it.\nAvg Price: $15 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Weekendeatwhat"

Nouri serves what the restaurant terms \"crossroads cooking\", where chef Brehm draws influences from cuisines across the world. The best way to understand his cooking philosophy is to splash out on the 5- or 7-Course Chef's Tasting Menu ($140/$170) for dinner, and ask to sit at the chef's table to watch the team work their magic. What commences is a well-orchestrated experience of unique flavours and textures coming together in stunning dishes, many of which have the Burpple community raving. These include the Acaraje and Vatapa, which sees falafel-like fritters served in a flavourful turmeric and coconut sauce, as well as the Steak and A1 Keluak Mole, which features a grass-fed wagyu rump cap slicked in buah keluak and bone marrow sauce. Pro tip: For a more affordable initiation, visit at lunch for the 5-Course Omakase Lunch Menu ($85, not available on Mondays). A curated selection of mains are available a la carte (from $28).\nAvg Price: $150 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Blueskies Cottonclouds"

Consider sharing the starter of Homemade Western Style Pork Belly ($7.50) with tender meat and crispy crackling. They also offer some pretty interesting bakes like the Wolfberry & Osmanthus Cheesecake ($4.80), where the humble cheesecake is enlivened with a floral jelly topping.

For first timers, get the Tasting Platter ($35) with three different ceviches: Mixto sees seafood of the day tossed with Peruvian peppers; Tono combines fresh fish with crispy baby calamari, smoked aji amarillo (a kind of chile pepper) and a base marinade called Tiger's Milk; and Nikkei sees yellowfin tuna mixed with purple potato chip and avocado. Individual portions of the ceviche otherwise go at an average of $25 per plate. The ceviche here are all incredibly fresh and layered with textures, and are great paired with a Pisco Sour ($14). Save space for cooked dishes like the flavourful seafood rice Arroz con Mariscos ($34) and the Sudado de Pescado ($34), a fisherman's stew with white wine, yellow chilli, onions, tomatoes and Peruvian corn cider.

Sink your teeth into the crowd favourite Steak Sandwich ($10), where a nicely grilled steak is sliced into bite-sized pieces, topped with a generous portion of caramelised onions and slathered with bearnaise. All this is sandwiched between two slices of toasted bread that provide just the right ratio of meat to bread. For something heartier, go for the Lu Rou Fan ($10), a rice bowl topped with thick chunks of what we deem as the most tender braised pork belly, a sous vide egg and kai lan.

Burpple Tastemaker Xing Wei Chua appreciates how the the meat is tender, juicy and not greasy, and that the batter had a tinge of umami sweetness that sets it apart from regular katsudons.

Each bowl comes customisable in three categories of spiciness (which is adorably named after their bear mascot), from Baby Bear (level 0-5), Adult Bear (level 6-15) to Crazy Bear (level 16-30). Don't be afraid to opt for the higher spice levels if you're a spice lover. Then, pick from four soup bases — tomato and coconut, which are thicker, or Japanese and shrimp.

Swapping the noodles doesn’t make the most innovative of fusion food, and while I commend the effort I can’t say it necessarily works. The thing about pasta is that it’s a lot thicker than mee pok, so when cooked right and al dente, it has a nice bite and carries the accompanying flavours well. Unfortunately mee pok’s a lot thinner and even if cooked right (ie not soggy), it’s still really soft and limp and doesn’t add as much texture as pasta. Every mouthful’s pretty much just a lot of sauce without a good contrast. Can’t say I liked the mee pok over regular pasta, but for what it’s worth the sauce is fantastic and they were extremely generous with the bacon and mushrooms."

There’re a couple of reasons why, but let’s start with the soup bases. 2 types: layered tofu, and spicy fragrant. The former strikes a good balance in staying both light yet extremely rich in flavour, never once getting too thick or salty even as the soup cooks down. The latter uses the same master stock as the layered tofu soup, topped off with chilli oil and a blend of spices that the staff explains as being “more fragrant and spiced than it is actually spicy”. Exceedingly true, considering that I’ve never liked mala as a soup base but loved the complexity the Chinese spices added to this soup. And then we move on to the super fresh and top-notch meats priced lower than hotpot places here, as well as mega sweet seafood pastes (the scallops one is the bombdiggity). And and and then there’s their house made meatballs. I’ve never had a chicken meatball so good I swear I’d just order that for the whole meal if I could lolol."

Their Taipei Main Station branch was running buy 5 get 1 free promo, so of course I was gonna stuff my face silly. Texture-wise the croissants were crazy crispy on the outside, soft and bouncy on the inside, and still extremely buttery. Nothing like the mega-laminated ones (think TBB) we have back home, but yummy nonetheless. Of those I tried I loved the Garlic croissant and the Aomori Sun Fuji Apple one; the former was so good I could eat a box full of them."

A little oily yes, but so so crispy, light, paradoxically ethereal I’d even say. I was enjoying mine in their popular 薄饼, a thin flatbread stuffed with an omelette and said dough fritter. What I adore about Taipei’s flatbreads is they aren’t doughy and bready like those Middle Eastern/European ones, instead extremely flaky and even a little buttery, like a cross between prata and bread. Super shiok to eat, an absolute carb indulgence, and perfect when dunked into a bowl of thick, sweetened soy milk. It is immensely filling though and if, like me, you’ve got makan places lined up back-to-back, ordering a dough fritter alone would still bring 110% satisfaction."

It’s also exceedingly — like insanely — moist, the sides completely sticking to my finger when I stupidly poked it. And all the condiments really served to highlight and complement the hotcakes. Salted butter, freshly whipped cream, some hokkaido cheese sticks, and warm maple syrup 🤤 Honestly though for how moist, fluffy and light these were, I’ll pay the hefty NTD380 even without the extras on the side."

But then, look at that HEAP of pork on the rice rolls. Discounting flavour entirely, just that massive pile of chargrilled pork makes it completely worth the buck.

For our main, we could pick monkfish or quail, while dessert was either a yogurt or chocolate based one. Do note there isn't an a la carte menu so choice is rather limited.\nOnce we'd ordered, the warm, friendly staff brought out a mini sack containing slices of mixed seed sourdough bread slices with small bowls of whipped bacon butter (this was amazing!) and piquant, crunchy fermented cabbage. All made in-house mind you.\nShortly after, a platter with three types of loveliness arrived: a deepfried cube with lava-like sweet creamed corn within, a leaf on which sat a Galway Bay Oyster, beef tartare and oyster leaf mayo, and last but not least, a piece of crisped teriyaki chicken skin with pickled ginger. This was, not surprisingly, my favourite course of the entire meal.\nNext up, a bowl of housemade ricotta dressed with tender asparagus, milkskin and Comte cheese. Lovely but not particularly mind-blowing.\nMy artistically plated (but quite small-portioned) main course of monkfish had an Asian element of sesame. The sweetness of the accompanying root vegetables was pleasant but other than that, I didn't find the dish as a whole, all that spectacular. Perhaps it's because I prefer robust flavours and had picked the dish designed for someone with a more delicate palette. Oh well...\nFortunately, the chocolate, orange and honeycomb dessert was more up my alley. Besides the playful mix of textures, I also liked how the citrus note contrasted with the richness of the chocolate. Having said that, I stole a bite of my dining partner's dessert--the yogurt--and didn't stop. Admittedly, I fell even harder for that.\nI was looking forward to ending my meal with a cappuccino but alas, it was not to be. Cure, rather oddly, does not serve coffee. The reason given was their focus is on aperitifs and wine. I guess there's always the option of popping into The Lokal just around the corner to grab one.\nThe staff also shared with me their plans to change their menu monthly, so diners can always look forward to something new.

If you're feeling for the sun, there are al-fresco seatings available at level 2 @ Nosh that you will be sheltered under the pretty treehouse 🌴\nFor the varieties on their brunch menu was rather limited but the selections of their dishes was all about quality and I would highly recommend what I've tasted during this morning's brunch situation which were their Crab Benedict & Devil's Breakfast.\nFor those who are wondering, they are using Guatemala & Ethiopia roasted beans from Kaffe Kultur. Medium-bodied with a stronger blend of taste but low acidity.\nRating: 8.5/10\nNote: this wasn't an invitation tasting.\n"

The filling is relatively easy - onion, celery, carrots, mushrooms, cauliflower and chicken breast all cut to small pieces stir-fried in oil and a bit of chicken stock and Japanese curry roux. Thicken with a bit more flour and make sure to cool it down completely lest it turns the pastry soggy."

Fortunately we arrived at 11:20am and was the 2nd last to be admitted once the joint opened at 11:30am. I enjoyed the salad bar with its mist keeping items cold and fresh , the awesome potato salad and marinated beansprouts (that you can find at the Keisuke Ramen places). The fish I had was great too; the fish fresh and well-seasoned. Each set also comes with rice, an onsen egg, some pickled vegetables and miso soup. It was a filling yet seemingly healthy meal. Would be back! Suggest to queue up before opening hours."

I basted the beef and added garlic slices halfway in. I am so happy to have found the SteakMate app that cues me when to flip the steak based on the cut, thickness and doneness. I aimed for medium, but came out medium well which is entirely my fault because I rested it a little too long. I then drained the oil in the pan and threw in sliced mushrooms, gave it a good toss and splashed some balsamic vinegar in and cooked till soft. These are served atop washed baby spinach for a dressed up salad. This meal cost me about $7."

Egg floss was something unique and unusual in a Hainanese curry rice stall, it’s very light, fluffy and airy. Fried Pork chop were fried in small batches to ensure it’s crispiness and freshness when served. Their golden curry sauce is da bomb!! It’s absolutely delicious, with a lil sweet and savory, lil sticky and you can actually taste the fragrant curry spices in it! We love it when the aromatic curry covers the entire plate of white rice before they place the ingredients on top of it! If you order more curry, you may request for extra curry to go with it!

Do adjust the temperature based on your understanding of your own oven! I also used a mix of Apple juice and milk for a stronger flavor result which did work well😉❤️ will definitely try this again as practise makes perfect!✨ do comment and share tips on how I can improve or what is key to the perfect muffin texture💕🍎💕\n...\n...\n...\n#burpple #sgfoodstagram #sgbaker #sgeats #instafoodsg #foodforfoodies #sgfoodblogger #sgfoodies #sgfood #sgfoodhunt #sgfoodhunter #bakesg #foodinsing #sgfooddiary #singaporeinsiders #sgigfoodies #foodguide #singaporeeats #sgigfood #bakingrecipes #sgfoodblog #singaporefoodies #applecinnamonmuffins #foodexplorersg #singaporefood #foodinstagram #sgbakers #baking #sgbakes"

They use wagyu rump for the steak and it comes with fries or a liberal heap of smooth and buttery mashed potatoes. The steak itself is so juicy you don't need any sauce – just dab it on the truffle salt and you're good to go! Not sure about that salsa though; would have preferred some mixed greens instead!\nAnd the burger here is pretty legit too – a thick, succulent patty in between fluffy buns with arugula and tomato. Just wish there was cheese slapped on it (and bacon, though I was told that the meats used are Halal certified). Eat this fast otherwise the bun gets soggy from all the meaty juices. \nOrdered the 'taco' thinking we could share it but it comes in one huge piece. 😅😅 The amount of chicken chunks was super generous though (they use one whole leg!) and the marinade's pretty flavourful."

One baked potato was bad but was promptly exchanged for another side of our choice.

The buffet comes with side dishes like garden veggies, mashed potato, fries, and chili concarne, providing a variety of flavors to tickle your tastebuds. \nThe main event, their sticky ribs comes in five different flavors. Each portion ordered is a 1/4 slab. From nearest to furthest: Tuscan, Spicy Asian, Peppercorn, Hickory, Garlic. \nThe Tuscan had too much tomato and sauces which made it a little soggy, the Hickory was slightly dry and the Garlic was overpowering. With that said, I would recommend the Spicy Asian and Peppercorn which were my favourite. But for variety's sake, throw in the Hickory and if you must try more, get the Garlic. \nHeartiness (portion): 5/5\nTastiness (product): 4/5\nWorthiness (price): 4/5"

The first bite (tail end) produces so many different flavours and texture, the crunch, so comforting the sound as it crackle with every bite; it’s soul food. It’s something I have had since TFS opened all those years ago and I don’t think I will ever stop ordering my soul food. .\n@theflyingsquirrelsg is the brainchild of @chiefsquirrel , @hoseejack and @rai.kannu and bangs out quality Japanese and fusion Japanese food in a casual and intimate space at 92, Amoy Street.

While most can make a decent Bara, the secret of Chang’s Bara is in that tincture of sauce that provides the umami orgasm in your mouth, complementing the well seasoned slices of seafood. .\n.\nChef Chang’s is back in our shores but only for a little bit. The Pop-Up is at the uber chic @shingitaisg and today is the last day. I don’t know when he will be back. So try and get a space tonight, they offer both ala-carte and a 9-course degustation set. .\n.\nThanks Anthony and Jeremy for making this happen. .\nAwesome to see some of my most wonderful friends tucking into comfort food that we remembered."

I had the summer chicken stew which was a huge chicken thigh that was slow cooked in a sundried tomato, herbed cream sauce. But this was closer to a Chinese type of soup that was thin, smooth and easy on the palate than a usual western type of soup that is thick. It also came with huge chunks of potatoes and carrots to make a filling meal on its own. The sourdough that came with it was also able to soak up the essence of the soup well. However, we found that the dishes here seem to be a tad too salty for our liking, maybe the speed at which dishes have to be churned out played a part in that."

Ali BBQ sauce on and English muffin. Simple, and well executed, the eggs were scrambled to perfection, leaving silky ribbons to pair with a tangy BBQ sauce with bits (of what felt like a relish) in it to cut the richness of the bacon and egg in the English Muffin. You get a quick, delicious breakfast without the frills. Paired with an excellent filter brew of Indonesian Toraja Kalosi Natural, my Sunday morning was made much better today.\nIf you feel like experiencing a bit of Melbourne in Singapore, you have till 8pm tonight to get to @bearded.bella for your dose of @st_ali!\nThough it was nowhere as cold as Melbourne at the pop up and the vine, quite different from the cafe in Aussie, the food and coffee were reminiscent of my previous trips to @st_ali.

The Soy Citrus Salmon is cured to intensify its flavor, and torched (just before serving) for that smokey umami taste - the citrus is slightly lost and it could benefit from a spritz of citrus after the torching - however, this is still super delicious even without that. I found the buckwheat noodles to be quite unique in texture and that went very well with the mad addictive Soy Garlic Jang that I chose. Never have a rice bowl without a sous vide egg, so don’t forget to add that to your order on top of your free option of 5 sides. If you enjoy your gochujang and want something special, go for the Apple Cider Gochujang which is spicy and tangy at the same time (almost like a solid BBQ sauce but not). After adding your choice of sauce, put on the lid of the pretty Dosirak box and shake to combine the sauce with the rest of the ingredients and enjoy your delicious guilt free meal (all bibimbaps are under 500kcal if you are counting calories). Whoever said healthy food always tastes bland needs to eat their words.\nA suggestion for the team at Dosirak would be to have an option for an upsized box for the hungry boys in the office who need their carbs to function. (As requested by my colleagues who had them for lunch earlier this week thanks to Deliveroo). Thanks to @mdyteo @dosiraksg and @burpple for the invitation and for sharing the stories behind your concept. #burpple #dosiraksg"

However that request might have not been the wisest decision.\nThe scrambled eggs were done @mcdsg style (hard and lifeless). The broccolini was bland and could definitely use some char and seasoning. The portion of thick cut bacon seemed underwhelming (second picture shows half the piece of bacon). The dish was also devoid of any taste of truffle (despite its name) save for the 2 pieces of shaved truffle atop the broccolini.\nNow that I’ve put the description of the dish above, and took a second look at the second picture, I realized that the truffle hollandaise might have been accidentally left out of the dish, explaining the lack of ‘truffleness’ and the bland dish. We managed to still finish the dish with the help of some salt, and the excellent ham and brioche on the plate.\nGo there for the coffee, but I might fill my stomach elsewhere for now. #burpple #fiveoarscoffeeroasters"

Forget fancy, fine dining here — tables are packed elbow-to-elbow in the small space, there’s a lingering scent of the kitchen in the air and decor is kept to the bare minimum. Yet, regulars praise the place to the highest heavens, and with good reason. Helmed by chef Shaun Gian, the kitchen turns out perfectly executed European fare at prices that don't break the bank. Expect tasty eats like Truffle Fries ($7 for medium, $13 for large), Duck Confit ($21) and the crowd favourite, Prawn Risotto ($20). That said, the star of the night has to be the Black Angus Ribeye Steak, which comes in three different sizes ($21 for 200g, $38 for 400g and $50 for 600g). Seasoned simply with salt and pepper, and pan-seared to attain a lightly charred crust, the pinkish slabs of melt-in-your-mouth goodness are best enjoyed with dollops of the truffle-infused mayonnaise. Add Foie Gras ($12) to elevate your meal and sate your carnivorous cravings! End on a sweet note with their newly introduced Japanese Matcha Creme Brûlée ($7.90).\nAmbience: Super laidback\nPrice: Avg $50 per couple, without drinks"

While for those that likes a heavier taste, go for their A4 Wagyu Foie Gras Steak. From the Sanma series, my favourite is the Sanma Kabayaki that's well done & broiled in sweet tare sauce. 😋\n.\n📢 *[A4 Kagoshima Wagyu]*\nJapanese Wagyu cattle is exclusively bred and fed a nutritious diet to achieve smooth meat texture. Graded A4, the Kagoshima Wagyu is not only extremely marbled, it is packed with the distinctive umami flavor and lower melting point fat compounds that contribute to the melts-in-your-mouth sensation for which Japanese Wagyu is famous for. If you thought having such premium meat means burning a hole in your pocket, think again.\n.\n📢 *[Japan's Seasonal Fish, Sanma]*\nSanma (Pacific Saury) is rich with heart-healthy oils, and is considered a quintessential autumn delicacy in Japan. The fish is freshly imported from Hokkaido. In order to enjoy the fundamental quality of the fresh fish itself, the most common preparation of fish is to eat it raw, or to sprinkle salt and grill. Here at Sumire Yakitori House, diners can enjoy the Sanma in three different ways: Fresh sashimi, Salt-grilled and Broiled in sweet soy sauce.\n.\nThank you @singaporefoodlisting for the invite and @sumiresg for hosting us. 🙆🏻‍♂️\n.\n#sgfood #sumireyakitorihouse #sumire #wagyu #sanma #fish #japfood #japan #japanfood #bugis #bugisjunctionxbugisplus #singaporefoodlisting #food #foodie #instafood #tslmakan #8dayseat #local #burpple #singapore #foodies #singaporeinsiders #burpplesg #eatsnapsg #foodreviewsmr #hungrygowhere #vsco #vscofood #throwback"

The whole duck of Angelica Herb Duck (当归烤鸭) was however, tougher than the first one, wasn't that much of a pleasure eating it. From the chars it seems like it was a little over roasted. Overall we prefer the Ten Wonders more and would be good if they maintain the same standards throughout all their flavours. After all, it is not cheap for one duck at $40+ each so I reckon they should keep it up.\nBeen GrabFooding everywhere I go; Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Medan, Batam, etc. Just love the convenience especially when travelling alone in a foreign country.

For starters, we had the #salmonbelly that was fresh and went well with the wasabi pea purée and soya sauce. The #mushroomrisotto was really enjoyable with the interesting dehydrated enoki and flavorful creamy yet chewy rice. We went with their aged duck breast as the main and while one of us really enjoyed the unique flavour profile, with the pairing of duck with spices and a sweet poached pear, the other found it a bit dry and wished for a thicker sauce/ more refreshing take. The meal ended with delicious and unique desserts of coconut ice cream with laksa and shrimp flavouring, and a modern twist on a basil & strawberry cheesecake\n📍@brine.singapore, 775 North Bridge Road Singapore\n#cafehoppingbugis"

Heat, spice and all the savoury makes this simple nibble a crowd favourite. Great for teatime, great for anytime, and with a cheap price point makes this epok epok a no brainer."

Their take on local, and regional cuisine brings out the best in every seafood presented to me. \nMy personal favourite, would actually be the pearl grouper! Clean, subtle and very much alive dish, whereby the grouper is double fried to first seal the juices and next making the exterior crispy. Laid on top of baby Spanish and shimeji kombu , the dish is simply heartwarming. \nAnd to clean the palate with a sour sorbet, before a good hearty dessert and petite four, screams yum yum yum. A good course meal, that worth every dollar and space in my belly. \nCheers to local fare!"

Big on sour notes, and maybe way too much sour notes that one may think that you’re pregnant and crave for something of the extreme. From the menu, there is vodka, rum and gin, but sadly I hardly taste any of it. And mind you, this bubble tea is for the adults. \nDon’t get me started on the bubbles. They. Are. A. Disappointment.

Mains continued on a high with Miso Cod & Ulam Onigiri ($40) and Rendang Lamb Shank ($34) being crowd-pleasers with their robust flavours and melt-in-mouth quality.\nWhat truly took the cake was the sweet ending of the meal. It was a tie between the dangerously oozy CreatureS Chocolate Cake ($18) and incredibly pulpy Durian Cake ($12) for the top spot, while the Cempedak Loaf Tea Cake ($14) didn’t seem justified for its price tag.

Chef Freddy swops durum wheat for rice flour in the Spaghetti Alle Vongole ($28++), rendering a familiar mouthfeel reminiscent of a more al dente thick vermicelli (粗米粉) jazzed up with creamy white miso sauce and sweet clams.\nCome dessert, we clamoured over the deliciously balanced Calamansi Chocolate Tart ($16), while the Dairy-free Apple Crumble ($16) drew polarising reactions with its 8-spice blend; highly aromatic or overwhelming, you decide. #GFDF may be a tall order, but thankfully for us, was realised with aplomb by Chefs Ryan Clift & Freddy Ang and the ODP team 🤛\nThank you @opendoorpolicysg and @burpple for the invitation and hospitality!\n#burpple #opendoorpolicy #instafood"

Just the ban Chan alone is worthwhile for anyone to make a trip down . Who cares about the main course hahah?\n12 different ban Chans all with distinctively different flavours and textures . This was really the highlight of the evening for me .\nSpecial mention needs to be made of the potato salad which was puréed till so smooth and creamy ( without being cloying) and had little surprises of crisp apples within - this was surprisingly very light on the palate. \nThere was this pan fried egg layered with ham ban Chan that almost looked like an egg frittata that tasted so good .\nThe home made Kim Chi and bean sprouts were also very well prepared.\nThe rendition of ikan billis here was by far one of the best I have eaten across all Korean restaurants so far. Think high quality crisp ikan billis well seasoned ( without being overly salty or sweet ) and a little spicy , this was so addictive . \nAnd yes - the main courses were also good and very value for money .\nThis must be the best kept secret at Lorong kilat .

I was drawn to ordering this because of the grilled miso egg plant. And boy I wasn't disappointed, except that it should come in a slightly bigger cut. The white miso is torched and complements the eggplant's otherwise tasteless flesh. Comparing to the other items on the menu this is probably for the small eater. Well, don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with bowl, mushroom and tomatoes were well sautéed, kale was kind of air-fried to a nice marinated crips. Stir-fried chicken chunks were satisfactory and savoury. Corn was a must giving both the balance of flavour and substance, as the grain base used was quinoa, which was nothing short of tasty but was only a really thin layer at the base. At the end of it all, it might well be the case of too good (hence) too little."

But because August was my birthday month, I'd spoiled myself with far too many rich meals. Inevitably, guilt set in. So I wanted to \"eat clean\" to balance out those indulgences but had trouble locating a place to go. As fate would have it, I was invited by Word Of Mouth P.R. to a tasting at Wholesome Savour - a vegan and gluten-free eatery in Palais Renaissance. It seemed like the universe was trying to tell me something 😆\nAdmittedly, I was a tad worried because I generally like my food unhealthily delicious (\"more pork lard please\"). Hence, my secret fear was their food would bore me. However, the dishes I had, turned out to be actually much tastier than I'd anticipated. What a pleasant shocker!\nIt helped that while waiting, I learned from the friendly owner Jason Fong, so much about the company's approach and philosophy to food, as well as their on-site high-tech preparation methods.\nOnly ingredients with the highest amount of nuitrients make the cut and they use alkaline water in everything too. What's more, nothing, and I mean nothing, is \"cooked\" at temperatures above 46 degrees celsius. So the benefits of everything, from vegetable to nut, and spice to grain, are retained at their maximum.\nYou would think that prices would be exorbitant with all that effort but nope. The Smoothie Bowls pictured above were listed as $10++ each (I especially loved the one with housemade almond milk, bananas, berries and crunchy \"green-ola\"), while \"The Savour BLT\" with avocado, an ingenious \"bacon\" made from coconut, fresh vegetables and lemon cream sandwiched between onion and sunflower seed \"bread\", cost only $15++.\nThe strawberries-covered Hangover \"Bread\" (also $15++) reminded me of a dense alcohol-free fruitcake. Accompanying it were the most amazing cinnamon coconut almond butter, fermented cashew macadamia yogurt and berry-chia jelly - all made in-house naturally.\nI also realised how filling these ultra healthy dishes were as the hungry pangs didn't strike till many hours later."

The seemingly endless queue despite the limited seating area does say something about its popularity. \nIn a hearty bowl of mixed pork porridge, you can find offal such as pig’s liver, sliced pork and a piece of the large intestine. Perfect for offal lovers like myself. I must say they handled it pretty well, appropriate chewiness without any animalic smell. Supposedly cooked over charcoal, the porridge ranged between smooth and silky, though still less creamy than a Cantonese-style porridge but not grainy like a Teochew-style porridge. Served with drizzled soy sauce, spring onion and ginger slices. \nA popular side dish was their handmade prawn rolls. Slightly small in size with prawn chunks, but not to personal liking because of the heavy dose of spice powder."

It’s not just about the whiffs of fermented shrimps, but the flavour that permeated through the batter was strong within the juicy meat. No surprise that the marination takes at least 2 days. Every bite produced a loud crackle, as the crispy batter crumbled into tiny pieces. So glad that the lady was generous in giving us extra serving. \nThe chilli dip was a perfect complement to cut some grease, with its tinge of sourness, just as apt to pair with the aromatic chicken rice topped with a sunny side up. Only turn-off was the wings were already pre-fried and served cold."

Boasting of a robust flavour with a rich mouthfeel, this dessert-inspired drink gets even more enjoyable as smokiness of the caramelised sugar gets blended into the milk, though it could get a little too creamy towards the end.\nPersonally I preferred the brown sugar boba matcha latte. An intertwine of cold bitterness from the premium Japanese green tea with the warm, smoky boba turned out to be a harmonious brew, of precise sweetness. Fans of firm, bouncy boba, @boberteasg is the right choice.\n@boberteasg is also a #burpplebeyond partner where you can enjoy 1-for-1 bubble tea!"

It’s a clever way to infuse some green, herbaceous flavour to complement the freshness of the fish. Don’t forget the Thai-style dipping sauce to go with the fish, as it further accentuates the overall sweetness, a little tangy spiciness and some unami-ness from the fish sauce."

Personally, the sauce was tangy and slightly sweet instead of a spicier kick that could have probably made it even more flavourful. Despite so, I would still gladly mop up the sauce with the crispy deep-fried mantous that should not be missed. •\n@enjoyeatinghouse is a #burpplebeyond partner; food is even more enjoyable when you get 1-for-1 mains!"

While the Gin Khao Special watermelon fried rice, or Khao Phat Dtaeng Moe, was generous in portion and seafood ingredients, it was a little strange to savour warm watermelon balls, which could also be an interesting sweet twist to savoury. No doubt the watermelon contributed further to the sweetness of this dish, with pork floss and cashew nuts, I guess I would stick to my pineapple fried rice. Note that the serving in a watermelon bowl is only applicable to 2 pax portion.\nThe Khao Phat Kaneng Khiew Wan, or signature fragrant rice stir-fried in chicken with special green curry, was contrastingly savoury. There was no lack of onion slices, eggs and some vegetables though chicken meat was slightly lesser, but the tossing of rice in green curry resulted in an overly-moist and mushy texture of the rice. Also, it would have been more delectable if the green curry flavour was stronger instead of being monotonous.\nThanks to #burpplebeyond, I was even more motivated to check Gin Khao Bistro out for dining by the sea, despite the long travel!"

Sandwiched between the fluffy toasted buns for the cheeseburger that the boyf had were some slow caramelised onions, American cheese, chopped pickled jalapeños, house-made sauce and of course the beef patties. Burst of beef flavour with a hint of char the moment we took a bite off the burger from their handmade beef patties, but we would have preferred it not to be well-done as it resulted in a slightly dry texture. Nevertheless, the sweet caramelised onions and melted cheese rounded the meaty taste off wonderfully with some moisture. \nThere’s an option of original or spicy version for the fried chicken burger. I had the spicy version, which kinda reminded me of Mcspicy, but subtler. Complementing the crispy, succulent chicken thigh were a beautifully-colored house-made slaw and Hammee’s burger sauce, having a similar taste to the Thousand Island sauce. Though a spicy burger, the 🔥 which came trailing toward the end, was quite manageable. What really captivated me were still the toasted buns with a buttery aroma which hits the sweet spot.\nAll burgers are served with a side of paprika-seasoned fries.

A balanced proportion of brown sugar to ice cream, with real starchy pearls hidden within.

The familiar cooling minty flavour was soothing to the throat but didn’t quite blend well with oolong tea which was bitter. The white pearls were a disappointment as they just felt like some soggy starchy balls.\nWhat came as a shock was the double pearls brown sugar milk tea; I mean, brown sugar milk tea these days meant the brown sugar streaks on the wall of the cup but I guess it’s entirely different here. It appeared as a cup of normal milk tea but the taste of brown sugar was evident. Good save there, though aesthetically suspicious.

While some say the pork ribs were a tad too dry, I was surprised to taste the exact opposite. Except that it was a little salty (as spice powder was sprinkled on it just before serving), the meat was juicy and jerky, with nice brown edges.

Super authentic and delicious Vietnamese food that were extremely rich in flavor at an affordable price! Definitely worth the experience. We tried the rice vermicelli wrap with crispy roasted pork belly ($6.90) which is the centre of the attention in this picture and extremely delicious! We also had other appetisers like rice crackers and cucumber and caramelised pork accompanied with a pork and dried shrimp dip ($6.90), and also fragrant butter corn with dried shrimp ($3.50). For mains, we devoured the dry rice vermicelli with grilled pork belly and spring roll ($8.90) excitedly because pork belly is our all time favourite! Also tried the pho beef combination ($9.90) and the spicy pork combination rice vermicelli ($8.90). These were all washed down by the Vietnamese salty lemon date ($3.50) and the milk tea with grass jelly ($3.50). Ended off the meal with dessert! Never was a fan of Asian dessert as we've always preferred our ice cream and cakes, but these proved to be just as tasty! Tried the cream of mung bean with coconut cream and crushes peanuts ($3.50), Vietnamese three colour dessert ($3.50) and the sticky rice with black eyed peas dessert! 10/10 would recommend this place and we definitely will be coming back for more! ---------------------------------\n176 Orchard Road\n#B1-14 Singapore 238843\nMon-Sun: 11:30am - 10pm (last order 9:30pm)\nwww.phostreet.com.sg\nwww.facebook.com/phostreet"

The choux like pastry is called Shuu. However, it tastes much better than the French choux. It's thinner and more chewy. The crispy croquet top added an extra crunch to it. The custard filling is lighter, fluffier and more flavourful than the usual custard filling. It comes in 4 flavours; vanilla, coffee, matcha and black sesame. I tried the vanilla and I love it. I bite it so hard, the filling came dropping out thus didn't manage to take a pic of the filling. The next time I have it, I will be more gentle eating it. 😄 I'm going back for the rest of the flavours. Maybe tomorrow! 🤗🙆"

Had mint mocha and cappuccino since we ordered so much food! 😆 I love the simple scrambled eggs and wilted spinach on sourdough toast. The scrambled eggs are the best that I have eaten so far. Simple but really tasty. For something more explosive go for the Dirty Ronin sandwich. Explosive because the unassuming sandwich surprises you with a mixture of spicy, salty taste of miso mayo, chorizo, cheese and egg! It's my fave sandwich now. You can't find it anywhere but here in Ronin. The savoury French toast with bacon and braised Apple is another of my fave. Love the fluffy toast with the hazelnut butter. Usually I will order the pork sausage to go with it. A slice of the toast with hazelnut butter+braised Apple+pork sausage+the maple sauce sent into your mouth! Oooh.... Heavenly!! Love the savoury and sweet combo! #whatclariceloves #mynumber1cafe #mustvisiteveryweek #regularcustomer "

The seaweed tempura batter on every piece was light and nori-shing. They ran out of snow crab (sad), so they made up with an extra piece of prawn on top of the two already given together with scallop, squid, oyster, generous drizzle of ikura, and my favourite the king crab stick. It was the size of a fish fillet from LJS so I hadn’t expected it to be crab before biting into it. The juicy umami burst was astounding and left me stunned in wide-eye emoji mode 😳 I wish they had given more oysters instead of prawn, I tried my best to prolong finishing that fat morsel in three tiny bites haha.\n:\nThe multigrain rice had a nice chew and didn’t feel as filling as plain white rice, perhaps that's why this big bowl turned out to be a manageable portion. #burpple"

Uni Gallery carries three types - bafun (stronger-tasting and dark coloured when in season), murasake (mild and without the salty ocean taste) and aka, which is their house uni that’s sort of in between the earlier two and usually comes in larger portions.\n:\nFirst dish was da bomb - the Uni Bomb ($99) that is. We were advised to work our way starting with the Bafun and fried Sawagani crab, move on to the Aka uni with kegani or hairy crab meat, the wagyu and uni shutou yuzu (seasoned uni), and finish off by downing that shot of Japanese gin. I love the deep ocean flavour from the bafun, but the aka and crab meat combination was even more of an intense flavour bomb! Best part was washing all the seafood down with the shot (actually two, because @fionatingx was on medication that night) of sake-distilled gin that had a strong citrus flavour.\n:\nI’ll be posting more photos of what we had over the next few days...

At this Tiong Bahru Market stall, you can either be healthy and get just a few pieces of the tow kwar pop with some fruits for $3, or indulge in a rojak set for $4 or $5 portions.\n:\nI like that the grilled tao pok is more pillowy than usual. The addition of fresh red apple was welcoming since most stalls use green apple for the tart flavour, but my tastebuds favour sweet.\n:\nConfession: I only want to eat the fried youtiao (dough fritters) inside a rojak. I mean yeah sure I’ll take a few pieces of the turnip and nibble on the green mango or pineapple, but only to hide that I’m sneaking all the youtiao into my mouth - also easier when everything is (should be) drenched in the dark prawn sauce so ingredients are indistinguishable. The best part about this plate for me was surprisingly not the youtiao, but the thin crispy crackers, something I’ve never had in rojak before and it’s way better than fried youtiao which isn’t always sold crispy. Likely to be a healthier alternative too.\n:\nYou may be slightly disappointed that this rojak doesn’t have that much prawn sauce drizzled on, even though they gave a bit extra on a separate saucer.

The sage and truffle emulsion was amazing and packed a punch of umami. 👊🏼 The filling of minced veal was pretty tasty (a bit heavy on the salt but the buttery sauce helped to balance it) but what’s impressive was the perfectly al dente ravioli!! I don’t know how they manage with such thin sheets of pasta. The quality control here seems great as well - I was told that the chef wasn’t satisfied with his first attempt at my dish and redid it."

I really enjoyed how these dishes were prepared - light on the salt and oil, but still very flavourful. The live prawns ($28) were a little small but very fresh. The lion's head meatball here ($6 per serving) was not the giant meatball I imagined - a pleasant surprise! The presentation is super cute and the meatball did not disappoint. It was tender and the braising gravy was really fragrant. I'll be back to try the Peking duck which requires 30min to prepare!"

The don is delicious - besides the very good Japanese rice grains, the ebi is crisp and plump and I love the addition of shredded egg to the don. The teapot on the side contains bonito broth, which you can drink on its own or pour into your rice. I like pouring it into my last few spoonfuls of rice - the broth lightly flavours the rice and really helps to cleanse the palate. Service here is always cheery and the tissue packets have cute hand drawn cartoons on them."

The bun itself was cheesy, but you wouldn't want to do away with the cheese mousse, which was really fragrant and velvety smooth but not overwhelming. I would have eaten 10 more if not for the other dishes which were equally enticing!"

So if you are craving something more decadent, you would probably be better off having the lobster mac & cheese which my friend really enjoyed. I thought I'd be getting some crispy duck though, because that's what I have come to associate with duck confit."

The cheesecake part sits atop on the inverted Choux puff, smooth, creamy and rich just like how a good cheesecake would. Piped inside the spongy and crusty Choux is the Rose Moscato cream which is subtly floral and carried light hints of sweetness that replicates the Moscato. Fret not, for this kid-friendly Choux makes no use of Moscato in the making of the cream, but a fragrant and aromatic Rose Moscato tea which is immensely uplifting so there isn't a need to worry about alcohol content here. A pretty good Choux and an unconventional flavour to go for if you are spoilt for choice here!"

After a stomach growling wait, we found out what those things were. Tender, plump chicken, perfectly balanced rice with just the right amount of spices and oiliness and some of the most flavourful soup that I've ever tasted with chicken rice. Considering some chicken rice can come up to 8 bucks a set in foodcourts these days, I'd say this chicken rice is well worth it! Time for us to gear up and try some of their other tze char fare!"

It's not just a pretty face either; the soup was hearty with scallops, the small bites surprised us with their huge range of flavors, and the mains were excellent. Faith in set lunches restored!"

Caffeine-wise, the espresso was very mild tasting with a slight acidity and light body. Those who prefer a mellow coffee would probably enjoy this, but it definitely didn't provide the caffeine kick that I was looking for. Probably should have expected this \"OK\" standard, since they specialise in mobile coffee carts at events... 🙊\nNevertheless, it's a decently priced cuppa, and I'll prob try the hot version next time, since that's THE standard I usually judge my coffees by.

Unfortunately I did not have any appetite as I was suffering from diarrhoea, hence I got myself the Hainanese Toast with homemade kaya (RM4.50, ~SGD1.50).💕\n.\nOut of the 2 types of bread, I personally preferred the Hainanese Toast as it was thicker & fluffy ☁️, somewhat resembling a brioche. Especially enjoyed the crusty sides that was super aromatic after toasting. 🤤🤤🤤\n.\nThe homemade kaya was sweet, which brightened my tastebuds 😋 but I would very much prefer the Pandan Kaya we have in Singapore as I feel that the fragrance of the pandan elevates the coconutty flavours of the kaya. 💚\n.\nIf you are looking for a heartier breakfast, you can add their sous vide egg (RM2.50, ~SGD0.85) 🍳 to complete the meal just like at Yakun or Toastbox in Singapore. 🇸🇬\n.\nGuess I need to head to their original alley one for the 💯 authentic taste!

This, together with the many good reviews, made me looked forward to the coffee and food. \nIn picture is the soft shell crab burger, beef burger, chicken stew, nitro tea and nitro coffee. We also ordered the salmon and soba, burnt brussel sprouts, latte and a cold brew. \nHonestly I am really disappointed with the food and drinks. The only dish that’s good is the burnt brussel sprouts, and the curly fries that came with the burgers (better than Mcd 😛). The beef burger, soft shell crab burger and salmon and soba was okay, nothing too much to rave about. The main lead of the chicken stew - chicken, was bland and felt like it was cooked separately rather than with the sauce. The rosemary in the sauce was also too overpowering. \nThe nitro tea and cold brew taste ok, with refreshing berries and pleasant chocolatey coffee notes respectively. However both were a tad too sweet. I have expected the latte to be better (from the reviews but those we had opposite the street after the failed first visit was way better). The worst was the nitro brew. It smelled and tasted like water in an ash tray - diluted and slightly burnt (yes I have tasted it before unfortunately), the ones from SB are honestly better. \nHowever the service there is really good. Just wish the food and drinks were better (or I have not ordered the right stuffs)"

Huzbo had to go back to work, but I’ve stayed for the rest of the week at @orionhealing for a short yoga retreat. The food at Orion is INSANE. Fully vegetarian menu, with the most incredible selection of tasty meals. I really wish there was a place like this in Singapore, selling amazing and varied vegetarian food rather than poncy overly expensive dishes. This is a fermented mushroom burger. The word fermented put me off but my friend persuaded me to get it to share with her. It was the best veggie burger ever! Doesn’t taste like meat, but has an incredible strong flavour. The bread is made on site and is gluten free, with the texture of a crumpet almost. Served with cashew mayo (my new fave!), and a fragrant tomato salad with shredded lettuce, coriander and dill. .\n.\n.\n.\n#healthyfood #fitfood #detoxretreat #yogaretreat #veggiefood #vegetarian #vegetarianfood #salad #veggieburger #veggiefoodporn #thaifood #thailandfood #kohphangan"

Although presented not as stunningly as other tendon bowls, I feel like the quality of the tendon here is much better and it’s a better size as the ingredients aren’t overly big and not so much rice is given. (Truthfully, I’ve been staying away from eating tendons because they always make me so uncomfortably full.)\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThe batter was light and everything was fried well. I particularly liked the fried shiso leaf because of how crispy and delicate it was and the prawns, which were really tasty and tender inside- not overcooked at all. Another thing I liked was that the tempura was only drizzled with sauce lightly, and there’s small bits of kombu on top of the rice.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nThought that the Special “Jo” bowl was sufficient. It had veggies like eggplant, kabocha (Japanese pumpkin), lotus root, bell pepper, shiso leaf, mushroom, 2 prawns and a lovely fried free range egg that was oozy inside. The Premium “Toku-Jo” bowl, which had the same tempura as the Special bowl (minus the lotus), and the addition of anago, fish and crab leg. Personally feel that I could have done without the additional tempura, which cost $8 more and wasn’t very outstanding. Nonetheless, the tendons here are quite worth it as they come with a salad with a creamy sesame dressing and miso soup as well.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nTheir space is on the smaller side, but it‘s quite warm and cozy, and I enjoyed this meal! They’ve also recently added a few new items to their menu - a cold inaniwa udon with assorted tempura and a tempura moriwase which has tentsuyu (a light sweet soya tempura dipping sauce with dashi and mirin). They both sound delicious, so maybe I’ll be back again when I feel like it."

It was definitely one of the top places I wanted to try after seeing how beautiful it looked on instagram.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nTheir long, twirly, ribbon-shaped Mafaldini is the perfect vessel for mopping up the butter and parsley sauce, with a hint of lemon so you don't get tired of eating this. The tanginess from the lemon also paired well with the springy chunks of gulf shrimp. The sauce is really the highlight here. Don't know what the ratio of ingredients is but I guarantee you that I finished ALL of it- it was so addictive. I also enjoyed the buttery breadcrumbs drenched in the sauce that somehow never got soggy and added pizazz to the dish.\n⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀\nIt's rather pricy, but most food in nyc is, so that's acceptable. (It’s cheaper if you go during lunch or brunch!!) Service was also not bad. The only sad thing is that they are cashless so we had to use Apple Pay to pay for our meal at a not too great conversion rate. Also, we tried the carbonara here and it was really disappointing so maybe not all dishes here are great."

The filled ones gave a boost of sweetness too, making them much more indulgent. \nIt's hard to pick a favourite, but I'd have to go with the Ferrero Rocher for its rich chocolate filling and crunchy hazelnut bits. The Lemon Curd was a close second as it is zesty, tangy and buttery all in one! One thing to improve on, though, is the consistency in the filling amount - the Earl Grey and Salted Caramel unfortunately had just a tiny blob of filling. "

While I loved the runny yolk, creamy hollandaise and fluffy pancake, I felt that this dish was created purely for the 'gram and novelty without harmony between components. \nPersonally, runny yolk with pancakes is already a poor combination as they're both soft; the fried kale wasn't crispy enough to provide a pleasing crunch too. The pops of saltiness from ikura were refreshing, but it doesn't gel together nicely with the rest of the ingredients (the first thing I thought of was sushi 😂).

However, I didn’t exactly like the texture of this pasta as it was kinda doughy for me. Overall, it was still a pretty decent meal.\n。\nWanted to try their Spaghetti with Sea Urchin Carbonara but most reviews stated that the flavour was quite one-dimensional, with not much hint of sea urchin.\n。\nP.S.

It was interesting bowl of Yong tau foo I guess l. I can understand the hype but I probably won't seek it out again so soon.

Add four beautifully sweet, plump scallops for just $1.80 (bringing the total to $17.80), and dig in to what is quite possibly the most indulgent takeaway food. The marinated chunks of salmon and tuna are perfectly meaty and fresh, punctuated by salty bursts of ikura.

If I had to nit pick I'd say the rice falls apart, which I know is a mortal sin for nigiri sushi, but hey this is SG not Tokyo."

I would rate the dish 8/10 , because the presentation of the dish caught my attention, the sauce (which is actually kicap manis sauce) blends in well with everything, be it the roast potatoes, salad or even the duck itself & also, it fills up my hungry tummy. The reason I did not rate 10/10 is because the texture of the duck is not that soft, like it has abit of dry taste, but the sauce and the skin of the duck makes up for its shortcoming. Overall, i give this cafe a 9/10 as I think it that not only the dishes are tasty, but the concept of the Cafe itself makes me want to visit this cafe again. It has a nice ambience with good music, the name of the dishes in the Menu are hilarious because it is pun-intended, and also, the service is top notch. Do not worry about ice water because as soon as you are brought to your seat, they will immediately serve ice water and the waiters there are friendly as well. A must go cafe in my opinion. "

But it won’t be hard to convince your friends that it’s worth it — the affordably priced, plump and juicy Oysters ($1.50) are enough assurance. Alternatively, find a day where you and your friends end work early and head straight to Teru at Tiong Bahru (they open at 6pm) to snag a table. Start the meal with some melt-in-your-mouth Sashimi slices ($12) before moving on to the oysters. For some carbs, go for the Shiok Maki ($20). It is an Unagi sushi roll blanketed with mayo, before being torched for a nice smoky finish. As for heartier eats, know that the menu is full of classed up versions of Japanese classics everyone will love. To put it simply, this is a group dinner slam-dunk.\nAvg price: $20 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Emily S"

The soft shell crab was incredibly crunchy with sight of crab roe and chunks of meat which paired off so well with the eggy & moderately spicy chilli crab gravy. On the other hand, the chicken chop has a shattering crispy batter packed with such rich & fragrant salted egg flavour that I relished every bite of it. Yum! 😋\n#burpple #burpplesg #stfoodtrending #sgfood #sgeats #foodsg #wheretoeatsg #whattoeatsg #jcubesg #wokinburger"

They've since planned their inventory better & when I turned up again, there was a short queue of 5 people ahead of me for dinner.\nI'd recommend making provisions to either dabao/takeout or find an alternative space like I did to eat. Don't expect to find a seat in their small shop space; the dining area has only 4 high chairs in a cramped corner, so I decided to eat at the pedestrian bridge overlooking the main road. (Hence the background, lol)\nChunky's Original ($16 nett) & Chunky's Connecticut ($16 nett) spoke out to me because the last option was full of cheese, which I wasn't feeling that night. Although the portions are small - it is, after all, LOBSTER & at a very affordable price point, so that didn't bother me. The bread was soft & tasty, though I would have honestly liked it to be a bit crispier on the outside.\nWhat blew me away was the lobsters themselves - the real MPV 😂 The lobsters are soooo juicy! Taste-wise, the Original was simply umami & very refreshing. The Connecticut had a tinge of buttery saltiness that was amazing. I loved them both.\nThe tapioca chips were also super good, I hope they can sell these as an additional side. Cut slightly thicker than the ones you eat over Chinese New year, they also have a bit of wasabi powder sprinkled over them which is really lovely.\nThe only disappointment I felt was that I opted for Set Menu B (+$3.90), which gave me a Lobster Bisque (U.P. $3.90) & Lemonade (U.P. $1.50) with my meal. The lobster bisque was disappointing, it had an artificial lobster flavour & the thick consistency of canned soup. The Lemonade was alright - I'd order it again as a Set Menu A (+$0.90) add-on to my lobster roll, just to quench my thirst.\n100% would return here again for this humble-looking lobster roll. It might not be everyday grub, nor would it completely fill up my belly.... But I really enjoyed it. That much. 😍\n💷 Cash/NETS only\n🌬️ 4 air-conditioned seats available\n📶 No WiFi available\n🙋 No Service Charge\n🚫 No GST"

It’s also one of #burpplesghot100 “Sweet Tooth” stores! 🍭\n.\nI decided to try the earl grey cream puff and I have to admit, it’s really one of the best cream puffs in Singapore! The puff itself was of the right thickness and the puff was soft on the inside. The cream was definitely the highlight of this whole cream puff. The cream had a nice balanced earl grey flavor and wasn’t overly sweet, which I enjoyed thoroughly. The puff was also PACKED with cream!! The cream flows out so smoothly from the puff so do bring some tissues with you if you’re planning to eat it 🤤\n.\n📍: Shuu Choux (same tenant space as 52 Sandwich Shack) ; Raffles City Shopping Centre B1-54\n🕐: 10am-10pm"

The place is hidden behind Maki-San & its a really small place so some might miss it when pass by.\nThough small, it serve interesting flavours like Chendol, Avocado Gula Melaka, Vanilla Oreo, Green Tea Yuzu, etc.\nGotten their waffle promotion as recommended by the shop & indeed I had no regrets.\nFor the price of $8.80, you get belgium waffle with 1 flavour ice cream topped with 1 topping & a drizzling sauce. Good deal!?\nWaffle was crisp on the outer while soft & fluffy on the inner. You can choose between original, whole-wheat & sesame. Taken the sesame waffle where they put white sesame together with the batter while making the waffle. Can't really taste the sesame though but nonetheless the waffle is superb, that strong fragrance while they are making it makes you excited. Like it when they cut into 8 bites pieces for you already.\nSo normally, I will have either Rum & Raisins or Strawberry flavour but this time, GREEN TEA YUZU win me over. I like how the combi is blended so well where you can taste both at the same time. Matcha 1st then yuzu aftertaste. Just WoW.\nTopping is caramelized hazelnuts & the sauce I get was the strawberry. Heng... Never pour all into the waffle else confirm sweetness overload so I just dip my waffle for extra pleasure.\n.\n🚩Icetaly, 676B Woodlands Drive 71, 01-15, Kampung Admiralty, Singapore 730676\n.\n.\n.\n#mehmehfoodventure #mehlicious #tastisfying #foodie #foodblogger #foodblog #sgfood #foodsg #foodcoma #burpplesg #burpple #foodinsing #eatmoresg #panasweather #hotday #icecream #gelato #sweetnessoverload #sweettooth #icetaly #kampungadmiralty #admiralty #waffleicecream #waffles #newlyopened #greenteayuzu #greenteayuzuicecream #shiok #dessertlover #dessertlicious #desserts #chill #relax"

The pizza crust also nails the right balance of light and chewy. For no-brainers that hit the spot, try The Hangover ($18), a protein-packed option topped with pepperoni, fennel sausage and roasted onions; or go with the Burpple community's favourite, Truffle Shuffle ($18). The white sauce based pizza comes heaped with mushrooms, fennel sausage and a good hit of white truffle oil. You might want to get a basket of their signature Alt. Wings ($12) to share too. These pack quite a bit of heat, so dip them generously into the accompanying blue cheese dipping sauce!\nAvg Price: $20 per person\nPhoto by Burppler The Pseudo Epicure"

So I seized the moment when the outlet was just a few days old and not many people know that they are open in jurong west to get my hands on one of their signature---the oolong milk tea.

The pistachio w baileys panna cotta 🍮 also caught me by surprise with the baileys cream being intense in flavour, complementing the nutty flavour profile of the pistachio! 💞\n—\n❣️ Thank you @saveursg for the delectable meal!\n—\n#burpple #instafood #foodstagram #8dayseat #whati8today #sgfoodie #sgfoodies #eatmoresg #tslmakan #stfoodtrending #saveursg #singaporeinsiders #melmeleatsbugis"

Beside their famous Wanton Mee, these Ngo Hiong were worth dying for.... it’s so mouth-watering and we are so hooked to it!! It’s like those homemade ones with crunchy bits of chestnut filled with juicy pork, well deep-fried to crispness! Its been awhile since we last enjoyed a good plate of wanton mee!

On top of the pâté is some ginger & berry reduction that honestly didn’t much for me. It was a tad too strong & overpowered the pâté. The grilled sourdough was also a lil too caramelized.

The noodles however, was a big disappointment. At first glance, the broth looked really light & blend. Not their usual rich & reddish broth. Although it was the authentic 红烧 flavor, it tasted really blend & one dimensional — more like soy sauce diluted in water. Noodles texture & ingredients were great but as everyone knows, the broth is the true star of every bowl of noodle & this fell really flat. A far cry from their younger days where the broth was rich & packed w flavor. Not sure if the recipe was tweaked after being under the Paradise Group wing, but I think they should tweak it back."

While their Blackmore’s Cube Roll beef was well marbled and well seasoned on the exterior while retaining the original flavors of the beef on the interior. On a surprising note, their Burnt Ends Sanger was praise worthy too for the chunky pulled pork and well blended flavors of the coleslaw that was refreshing with a piquant note to it."

Highlight of the buffet is definitely the wide variety of selection they have and the live cooking sections. The Pan Seared Foie Gras, Lobster Egg Benedict and Black Chicken Herbal Soup are definitely not to be missed. Their version of Singapore Sling with Vodka as a base was incredibly well created too!"

Even the gravy lingers with coconut fragrance. 油条 on the other hand lack the airiness and crispness. .\nDon’t miss out the fermented fried pork belly which is not at all greasy but addictive; sambal winged bean with pork floss which had an interesting texture and hint of spiciness to it and the bold combination of local flavors to the classic carbonara which replaces the traditional pasta with mee pok and topped with bacon bits and mushroom slices too! The dish was creamy yet at the same time surprisingly light. .\nWill probably be back to try their Sambal Grilled Fish!"

One of their to go for broth is definitely the mushroom base! Not overly thick but fragrant and flavorful enough. Mushroom broth seems to be the upcoming trend too!

Some of their famous varieties includes Ro Ppong which is their tomato cheese cream base and this Cha Ppong which resembles the Korean style jjampong. \nNoodles were springy and seafood were plump and fresh just that the squid were a little over cooked and on the chewy side. The soup was piquantly spicy, a little tangy and has a subtle seafood kimchi flavor. Pretty like this dish a lot! \nBeside jjamppong, they do have other items like risotto (soi chicken risotto) and pizza (garlic pizza but with a surprising sweet twist to it) which are pretty amazing too!

The vanilla ice-cream carries the neutral flavours and a creaminess to help counter against the Koicha, with the speculoos cookie crumbs adding a sweet crunch to the dessert. Thought the dessert was a little off balance, being slightly heavy on the Koicha — probably could be better with a slightly larger scoop of ice-cream and more speculoos cookie crumbles provided."

This pizza sees a white sauce base with black truffle (there's traces of the real stuff in there!), mozzarella and egg (ours came flowy and nothing short of all your #eggporn fantasies) — a cheesy, savory delight a hint of truffle and eggy goodness."

Almost essentially a fusion of soufflé pancakes and Thai Mango Sticky Rice, the coconut sago replicates that of the coconut milk and glutinous rice of the said dessert — a rich, coconut-y aroma with a slight chew, almost like the Thai dessert when eaten together with the Honey Mango that carried a balanced sweetness. The Passionfruit Compote helped to add a zippiness to the jiggly and wobbly soufflé pancakes; light, airy and fluffy, the pancakes carry just a slight hint of egginess that was pretty enjoyable — the Chantilly adding an equally light and slightly more neutral sweetness that binds the elements together. Whilst this is the priciest item on the menu at $14.80, the Classic Souffle Pancakes are priced at a reasonable $8.80; a rather decent price for a stack of two to sort the soufflé pancake cravings out. A pretty convenient spot to hit when the cravings hit, considering its rather centralised location; a place which would certainly see some queues in time to come."

From the first instance when the buttery fragrance hits you, to the friendly staff explaining the origins of their bakes, to humbly asking for feedback before every single customer leaves - exactly the spirit every bakery should have regardless how popular they get! 👍🏻👍🏻 Sor Hei not only has a beautiful origins history (shaped like a Majie’s hair bun), but tastes just as good as it looks! Seemingly simple black and white Danish pastry with chocolate chips, every intertwining layer was just the right amount of buttery without being overly cloying - flaky on the outside and soft pull-apart on the inside 🤤🤤 PSA: 10% off every Monday and buy 2 free 1 about 30 min before closing! (And they close early at 5 on Mondays!)"

Chicken leg confit would be a more tender choice, while chicken wings were really crispy and flavourful (and also same price as with just the salad bar). Main star of the meal definitely has to be the free-flow salad bar that comes with a whole variety of salads (chickpeas, kidney beans, mixed salad, cherry tomatoes, peppers, sunflower seeds etc), many many sauces, cooked (slightly unhealthy) food (potato wedges, buttered corn, sautéed mushroom), soups minestrone and cream of corn), fruits (watermelon, honeydew and grapes - all very very sweet) and drinks (fizzy drinks, ice lemon tea, mocha/Milo, very diluted coffee)! Definitely a very value place to come for a heart meal with unlimited Astons sides with a protein-rich main (and definitely appreciate the prompt service and no time limit) 👍🏻👍🏻"

Other meats like lamb, beef rump and fish were a little dry, while chicken thigh was done well (it’s a cheap meat so can’t fill up on these HAHA). Salad buffet was pretty limited with the usual basic vegetables (salad base, sauces, broccoli, cauliflower, carrot) with very mediocre carbs (tasteless aglio olio, tasteless rice, 2 potato salads; go for the fresh hot grilled garlic bread instead!) and some protein (meh prawns, dry chicken, meh sausage skewers). Recommend to just go there and whack the meat buffet, cleansing your palate in between with the hot sweet goodness of the pineapple (and other fruits like watermelon and honeydew), and end off with ice cream! (Thai milk tea is pretty decent!) PSA: Only worth if you use eatigo for 50% off between 1745-1845 and 2115-2215 daily (they close at 2300)!!"

They are served with a sweet & sour sauce (mostly sweet) and cucumbers; when eaten on the go, these are cut into bite-sized pieces and placed in a box before being drenched in the sauce, and garnished with cucumbers to add some freshness. The fritters remain wonderfully chewy, and it doesn't taste as oily/greasy in that way.\nThese were from Jakarta, but if you're in Surabaya, one of the more famous ones are from Pempek Farina which I favour actually, because you can really taste the fish!

They have a different menu on rotation everyday with the most popular days being Tuesday (Nasi Campur) and Thursday (Nasi Lodeh). So, I waited eagerly and patiently like a kid waiting for Christmas, or a Tuesday in my case and was thrilled to have finally gotten my hands on a coveted packet.\nNo doubt it is a good plate of Nasi Campur (the local mixed rice), but personally I found it to be too spicy to enjoy. It wasn't that I couldn't take the spice level, I could (barely); but when I picked out at least 20 chillis in a single plate alone, it was pretty hard to identify any other flavour profile besides \"spice\".\nJalan Darmo Permai Utara X No.18, Suko Manunggal, Tanjungsari, Suko Manunggal, Kota SBY, Jawa Timur 60187"

It usually comes with tahu (fried tofu which soaks up all the wonderful broth) and siomay (Indonesian siew mai usually made from the same beef in the meatballs and some fish paste). To up your bakso game, interesting add-ins include bakso puyuh, a personal favourite of mine, which features a whole quail egg inside the meatball. Add in sambel (chilli), tomato sauce for some sweetness, a drizzle of kecap manis (dark soya sauce) and a squeeze of lime and tuck in! Soak the fried fritters in the soup for extra shiokness, though I'll have to say the ones here were pretty disappointing but everything else was on point!\nJalan Manyar Tirtoasri, Gang.

They are a little too oily for me though, but I guess that's precisely why they're so good. I usually like my waffles plain, but I can never resist Ovamaltine (which is an extremely popular spread here, and offered in almost all the waffle stands I've been to yay!). The dark chocolate sauce is also really good here, not too sweet and gives a very nice, indulgent chocolatey taste to the waffles.\nMy favourite waffles however, will still have to be the HK egg waffles in Grand City, just because they're just as good without being too greasy.

There's no peanuts either, but having these deep fried means there's still a nice crunch, though a non-fried version is also available. As with many savoury snacks here, it's served with green chilli which people just eat for a solid spice kick in between bites.

I'm sure some Italian chefs will be aghast by this, but I get why this is a favourite- nothing fancy, but strangely addictive.\nHowever, my favourite item of the night was definitely the Fiesta Noodles. Because it is quite strong in its shrimp flavours, I think it's a dish that one either loves or won't be fond of, and I certainly belong in the first camp. It reminded me of a thicker, more robust version of the Mee Soto (even the cellophane noodles used are the same).\nTheir other sides were nicely done too; the fries took us by surprise because they looked stale and dry but were actually crispy. And of course, I appreciated the fact that they served white rice because that's how fried chicken is served Indo fast food chains too!\nThe two of us couldn't finish this meal meant for 5 I reckon, but that night, we happily brought back a half filled bucket and 2 pot (bellies) home.\n"

I believe the yangnyeom flavoured ones were only drizzled with specially blended sauce. We ordered the mild spicy one but found ourselves ‘sl-sl-sl ‘ away cos of the spiciness hahaha.

But having seen a long queue outside, we knew something was up and found out from Burpple that we had to order this dish. \nThe dish borders very closely to a butter pork rib like dish with the sauce, but it is well flavoured and fragrant, not overpowering with the salted egg which I do enjoy. The ribs are tender and go very well with the sauce. All in all a great dish and you just need some rice and maybe a fried egg to go with it."

We went with intention to pay for it but it turned out that they were having some special event and were giving it out for free!

I like the fragrance of the black sesame bun when paired with the salted egg sauce. The sauce was quite fragrant with a little bit spiciness which I loved. The chicken was tender and not overdone, and the skin was crispy too."

The soup is made with a medley of ingredients such as pork bone marrows, chicken bones, niboshi (Japanese dried infant sardines), vegetables, Japanese dried scallop and prawns. \nThe premium ingredients give the soup a robust and piquant flavour.

There was a snaking queue when we went to Tai Cheong's first cafe concept cum takeaway outlet at Holland Village. \nI knew I had to order the beef rice with silky omelette upon seeing it on the menu. Other patrons dining there also had at least one of these silky egg dishes on their tables.\nThe egg was indeed silky and the accompanying sauce was full of umami flavour. Not to mention the beef slices which was thick and tender. This whole dish was truly comfort food for me and the prices were very reasonable.

They were really friendly and warm, offering to help us with anything we need and even asked us if our dishes were up to standard. Though orders might take a little longer to serve, but the quality of food served makes up for it.

But last Friday I finally had my first taste of it at Vatos, and probably because it's Korean-Mexican fusion food I fell absolutely head over heels with it!\nI ordered: Spicy Chicken Quesadilla...\nthat's wrapped with spicy chicken chunks & topped with sour cream, arbol chili sauce & diced onions. It was such a delight to have, since all the ingredients blend and compliment each other so perfectly!\nVanessa ordered: Chimichurri Chicken Taco...\nthat consist of spicy chicken, Mexican cheese, lettuce, onion, chimichurri salsa and sour cream served on 100% corn tortilla. I had one and it was pretty good; it tastes much healthier than mine since the ratio of meat to veg in the tacos was probably 2:1? Hit my week's quota of veg intake after that! :)\nSide order: Honey Tequila Chicken Wings...\nWings coated in sweet & spicy honey tequila sauce, served with deep-fried masa-battered jalapeños, cilantro & blue cheese dipping sauce. Yup! The blue cheese dip caught our attention and it was practically a must-order-and-try for us. The wings were superb by itself; really well-marinated and it though drenched with sauce the skin's still very crispy while the meat inside retained it's freshness and juiciness to it. The blue cheese dip wasn't too bad since there wasn't the pungent smell that I recalled of it having, but I'd prefer to eat the wings without the dip.\nMust-mention: their Iced Peach Tea\nMaybe it's because the weather outside was scorching hot, but boy did I regret not getting the large glass because it tastes really good! Just order that and tried it if you do visit them to know!"

But this is a levelled up version with prawns and onsen egg, and of course topped with fried ebi (or what I call hei-bi). The pan-seared barramundi never fails too; crispy-skinned and it’s meat still moist. Oh and thumbs up for the plating too. 👍🏻"

Penne pasta with pink sauce that had been flamed with Absolut vodka. So rich and creamy, hence a good choice that we had shared that too."

Would have preferred a more homogeneous mix of the ingredients with the fries. Of course, we got our usual favourites as well: Hawaiian Teriyaki and Avovado Beetroot; can’t go wrong. ☺️"

The star of the dish is none other than the fried smashed chicken that glistens in vibrant orange (my favourite colour just fyi). The chicken is VERY tender and comes off the bone surprisingly easy. The skin is crisp while the meat is succulent and tasty, so much so that I pretty much forgot about the presence of the chili sauce. 😋 The dish is accompanied with crispy batter generously topped over the chicken, white rice, a side of vegetables and tempe, along with a bowl of soup which I personally enjoyed despite feeling like my health was at stake due to the oiliness of it. 😨\nI must say, this very plate of Ayam Penyet definitely impressed me a lot; that chicken is a stunner, both appearance and taste wise. Definitely worth checking out when you're in the area!"

It is served on a tray that's sent straight to your table and cut into strips before being served. Each piece is juicy and flavourful due to natural enzymes breaking down during the aging process, and I personally feel the meat doesn't require additional sauces to pair with. 😋\nWith an unbeatable price for such a cut of steak, along with other offerings on the menu here, this is one fancy restaurant you could be at for a fulfilling dinner with loved ones or for a special ocassion. 🥰\nThank you @theranchbyastons for the tasting spread and @sugarylink for hosting! 🙏🏻"

Pearls are more on the chewy rather than soft side, although the bite is rather enjoyable anyhow, and they don't really taste of much, but that can be overlooked considering the sweetness of the boba drink itself! Price is a little steep, but I guess a treat every once in a while after a busy school or work week shouldn't be too bad an excuse to enjoy this. 😉"

Cilantro lime is also pretty distinctive in taste, so if you like the herb, you would surely enjoy that! 🙂\nWhile the fried chicken is, to me, the sure fire star protein of the menu, the grilled chicken and duck are pretty delicious too! Vegetarians, fret not for tofu is also an available protein option! I'd highly recommend the deep fried enoki mushrooms too which are crisp and soooo good! Don't forget to pick a sauce to accompany your dish: from teriyaki to roasted sesame or spocy hot devil to 'lao gan ma' chili! 😋\nPrices start from $9.90 for a regular portion inclusive of 1 protein, affordable and substantial enough for an ideal dine-in or takeaway meal. 👍🏻 Thank you @paddyfolks @craze.sg for the food and warm hospitality, and @darr3n0ng for the tasting invite! 🙏🏻"

Boozy and texturally well-balanced, this was soooo good that I had close to two glasses! 😍\nThe Beef Stew with Mashed Potato and Chips is undoubtedly one of my top tier dishes here; tender and savoury chunks of beef soaked in what tastes like an alcohol-infused brown gravy, with a side of smooth, delicious mashed potato.

Flavours have definitely changed up over the years (or maybe I've just been MIA from their stuff for way too long) with classics having been retained after all these years!\nThe Maple Latte Pie ($7.50) was something new to me, and having just come back from the stereotypically presumed land of maple syrup not too long ago, I was definitely drawn to this quite instantly. The creme is more of a coffee base with distinguishable traces of maple, and nuts, for a balanced bittersweet flavour and the cake (?) layer is pretty interesting and unique to the dessert. The cookie bits are added upon order just to make the pie a little prettier than already is. 🥰\nOne thing that has caught my attention though is the drastic decrease in their base thickness; it's pretty thin to the point where - especially with this one - I feel like there's no pie base at all. I did experience this the last time I was at their Upper Thomson branch, but simply don't recall it being like this couple of years back. The base of a pie is surely essential to the foundation, and overall texture and taste of it so that aspect did disappoint a little. 😧 That said, flavours are still pretty spot on and overall, it's still a place I'd go to when I'm craving for a dessert that simply stands out from the conventional without feeling like an Instagram gimmick. 😌\nPro-tip: don't forget to redeem one-for-one deals here with @burpple Beyond should you have membership! 😉"

Gotta love that kuromitsu sauce which adds an extra layer of sweetness to the dessert without drowning the matcha elements away. 🥰\nThe Matcha Chocolate Cake ($6.50) is really rich with a dense, fudgey texture which might encourage sharing if you're afraid it will get 'jelat'. Chocolate is definitely the stronger component here but that's not to say the matcha falls under the radar; in fact the slight bitterness of it did leave me pleasantly surprised! 😋\nFor drinks, I had the Matcha Kuromitsu Latte ($8) which I really enjoyed! I personally believe that you can never go wrong with a matcha and kuromitsu pairing, and I'd have to say this pairing comes second to white chocolate and matcha for myself (a casual suggestion right there, maybe?) but this definitely satisfies, especially the cold option which contrasts perfectly against our sunny weather! 😁\nWhether you're a raging matchaholic or just want to satisfy some Japanese dessert or tea cravings, Nana's Green Tea is a surefire place to do that job!\nShoutout to @foodie_quest and @nanasgreenteasingapore for the tasting invite! 🙏🏻❤️"

Though we were starving, the Chef patiently cooks individual portion to the perfect timing before delivering it to the next Chef for the toppings. After mixing it, the thick noodles absorbs the peppery sauces and it somewhat reminds us of the nostalgic, Bar Chor Mee. The ingredients paired perfectly and we had no problem slurping till the last bit. Do note that they serve a small bowl of Japanese rice to be mixed with the remaining sauce. 📷 @whereisthelav"

This is the Vietnamese Bread with BBQ Pork. At $4, this is probably the best Bahn Mi you could get at such price. Prepared on the spot, the baguette comes totally crisp on the exterior, yet fluffy and comes buttered on the inside with a chopped peanuts for a bit of crunch and flavour (didn't know about the peanuts when I ordered though), while the pickled vegetables were tangy with a little sweetness. BBQ Pork isn't really flavourful, nor the portion could be said as generous but the slices were chunky enough to give it enough bite, but it is saved by the oh-so-savoury bun and the flavorful condiments that the pork doesn't have to carry much a taste for this to be enjoyable."

Enjoy a classic chicken or beef pho, crispy fried spring rolls, a refreshing bowl of grilled pork with vermicelli, or garlic cockles. If you love spice, don't miss their Spicy Beef Stew Noodle Soup — it's so darn satisfying. It can get crowded, especially during meal times, so expect queues! For a really tasty, affordable Vietnamese fare at under $10, it's well worth the wait."

Appetizers, fruits and sauces are available too with no extra charge. Dishes came rather quickly but order 1 pax portion to better gauge the amount before ordering more. We were so stuffed from our orders haha! I had the Ma La and Chicken soups, both were quite average. Not quite something I would return to although portions of dishes were generous. "

We rate this 8,/10.\nTips go early like 9am on weekends to avoid the long queue.\nleongvic\n#burpple#singaporeinsiders#eatoutsg #foodiegram#sgfood#foodsg #instasg#instafood #hawkersg#sghawker#instafood_sg#jiaklocal #hungrygowhere#cafesg#sgfoodblogger#vscofood#singaporefood#cafehoppingsg#sglocalfood#singapore#sgcafehopping#cafehoppingsg#dessertporn #sgfood#iweeklyfood#eatoutsg#sgfoodporn #Leongvic #opwmedia"

The laksa pizza comes with a really legit laksa paste and abundant toppings like sotong, quail eggs, tau pok(I think), prawns, chili padi...and the whole agglomeration of doughy goodness is sprinkled with little laksa leaves!!!! Which really elevates the taste and sets it apart from laksa pizza from other establishments. \nThe carbonara pizza looks pretty simple with just a few strips of bacon and a runny egg in the centre but - CONTRARY TO APPEARANCES - is packed with so much flavor!! The garlicky bechamel paste is salty to the right degree and meshes so well with their thin dough. Break the yolk and spread it all around for more oomph!!! \nIf you’re a carb lover, get a serving of their toasty little dough balls with garlic butter, you won’t regret it!"

Because apparently the base ingredient is sardine, each spoonful of the broth was expectedly rich in flavor, though the saltiness became apparent after a few spoonfuls. Ingredient-wise, this is a quintessential bowl of ramen with a perfectly done ajitama (why half an egg only though?), bamboo shoots, 2 slices of charred char siew that melts in your mouth, and thicc al dente-ish ramen noodles.

But once that fades, all you get is a bowl of REALLY. SALTY. ramen that lacks any distinctive flavor. The char siew - whilst grilled to a nice smoky char - still can be improved texture-wise as it was a little tough. Let’s not even talk about the very mediocre gyoza. Not worth the 20-30min wait imho, just go in a few months and pray that they’ll still be open by then."

This Tendon did not fail me. The Tendon was sooo good and it was not oily at all. The special tendon sauce was drizzled on the tempura and rice that enhanced the flavour to the peak. My favourite is the tempura chicken!!! 🐔 is the champion! The chicken is so tender, so juicy and so flavourful. It is really the best in the world!! My 2nd favourite is the egg... wooo omg the yolk (as per picture) slurp slurp..\nP.S. you will smell like a walking tendon though.. hahahaha"

Good for big groups. \nI especially like the hands on for making rice ball - the tuna was good but I want to try crab meat and roe next time! Ohhhhh and the squid and leek pancake is very good. Still crispy when cold. The sauce was a must to dip, and very good with the pancake. I also really liked the grapefruit yoghurt drink - great to balance the spicy dishes. The pickled lettuce and radish ban chan were good too. \nI was not particularly a fan of the chicken stew - definitely had potential but probably because I’m not a fan of chicken. Spicy level 2 was even too spicy for Indonesians! Beef is supposedly really good. The thick glass noodles, ricecake and mushrooms were good in the stew. \nWill be back with groups of friends!\n313 somerset B3-02, next to subway"

I got a bread bowl with it - very creative with green tea bread and charcoal bread but perhaps practically might have been better to eat sine with butter. The combo also gave a free genmaicha tea but wasn’t wanted for me since I already had soup. \nThe shop overall seemed mindful of recycling and waste but the tea cup was a typical wax cup with plastic cover.. \nGood place to stop by for a quick and light meal!

Nachos with guacamole were thoughtfully covered with cheese - very neat and unlike the typical Mexican pile of cheese and sauces.

Please do try their sarawak black pepper sauce as the taste profile is very robust, as one can not only taste the spiciness but also sweetness in the black peppers.

                "Review": "There's a lot on the extensive menu at this Somerset newcomer, but it's the quality of their Chirashi ($25) that bowled us over. Located at the front entrance of Hotel Chancellor @ Orchard, Zipang Japanese Dining Bar is helmed by three Japanese chefs, so you know your food is in good hands. Unlike other places where the chirashi can be a main, the one at Zipang is just enough for you to taste how fresh their ingredients are, but not so filling that you can't have other items. We reckon that the well-marinated cubes of sashimi on a bed of fluffy rice, topped with whitebait, makes a strong contender against Teppei's chirashi! For something heartier, order their specialty Crab Zipang Kama Meshi ($12) — traditional Japanese rice cooked in a small pot with generous chunks of crab meat and mushrooms. It takes 30 minutes to cook, so order this first before anything else. While waiting, the Deep-fried Eggplant in Special Sauce ($5) and the Asari Saka Mushi ($12) are both great for sharing.\nAvg Price: $25 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Shawn Loh"

This Japanese BBQ concept is perfect for all you wagyu beef lovers out there, especially those with bottomless stomachs to make this buffet worthwhile. The Deluxe BBQ Buffet ($49.80) grants you unlimited seafood such as squid, salmon and prawns alongside different cuts of pork and beef, but it is the Premium Wagyu Beef Buffet BBQ ($74.80) that is the one to go for — Wagyu beef rib eye cap with a marbling grade of 7+, and giant scallops that are too good to be missed! Top off this indulgence with free flow Haagen Dazs ice cream for dessert. Great for a group of six hungry people, you can even enjoy the view of the waterfront in their alfresco area, should weather permit!"

I felt that the soup in this ban mian taste wonderful and there was flavour. It was affordable and definitely would not be considered expensive for a bowl of ban mian in a food court like Fusionopolis. Additionally, the ban mian noodles was cooked well and generally, definitely recommended to you if you like ban mian. I am certain you will be able to polish off the whole bowl of soup!"

Additionally the crust of the coffee was not crispy, which should be the case of a coffee mexico bun. Inside the bun, it was too airy and not enough butter. Moreover, it was really very oily and difficult to eat. Not good and disappointing! Definitely would not eat this bread again"

Because I also bought nacho cheese bun together with it, the thongs that was used for the nacho cheese had some sauce on it and it caused my yam bun to be dirtied with the sauce. Additionally, I feel that the service and bread consistency in BreadTalk does not remain the same throughout all their stores. This means that some bread will taste nice while others do not. My yam bun certainly failed to satisfy me. It was dry, the yam was not sweet and additionally, it taste really bad because there is a lack of moisture in the bread. Disappointing!"

Flank itself is a fairly lean cut but not exactly tender and so, I had to give it an extra biting time. Every component blends very well, including that seemingly impotent salad. The best part was definitely the burnt onion mixed with discs of bone marrow, eaten with the flank. Foodgasm on every bite! On a side note, congratulations for the achievement! Ranked 14 for the best restaurants in Asia this year, Burnt Ends have indeed wow-ed me with the impeccable service and lovely dishes."

If you are a little fickle (hah), the Fickle Burger ($18.90) with foie gras, premium beef patty and sweet potato fries should be an easy choice.

We made reservations one week in advance, and still had to wait 30mins before getting a table! Idea of the seafood tower is to have tiers of different fresh seafood steamed and paired with a specially concocted sauce. They have scallops, prawns, shells (clams/ oysters/ blue mussels), crustacean (crayfish/ crabs) and stuffed squid. After devouring all the yummy (and healthy!) seafood, the last tier consists of steamboat that has taken in all the goodness from the previous tiers. You can choose the soup base from kombu dashi, Korean kimchi or ginseng chicken. Additionally, you can add in items such as luncheon meat, mushroom, ramyeon, just like steamboat. Overall, love the idea of the seafood tower and would definitely come back to try some of the seafood that we've not tried as we had a small table. "

                "Review": "To chase away the Monday blues, time to pamper yourself with some yummy Taiwanese cuisine from The Salted Plum. The Salted Plum has recently launched its second outlet @sunteccity west wing basement one with a more spacious dining area (76 seats). Featuring a few of my favourite dishes from The Salted Plum:\n🍽 Lu Rou 2.0 ($15)\n🍽 Cold Tofu ($10) - Haus Soy, Century egg, & Fried Shallots\n🍽 Burnt Chilli Chicken ($10)\n🍽 Sweet Potato Congee ($3)\n🍽 Taiwanese Sausage Patties ($10)\n🍽 Red Tea Jelly ($5)\nLu Rou 2.0 is definitely a must order when you visit the store, and personally as I have ordered the braised pork belly during my visit at the Circular Road outlet about a year ago (5 Aug 18 post), I like the upgraded version of lu rou especially with the light dang gui taste and the succulent meat which has a great ratio of meat:fats.\nThe cold tofu may sound like a simple dish, yet it is addictive. The sweet potato congee is actually good by itself as the chef have added dashi stock and fried shallots to enhance its taste.\nThe Red Tea Jelly with a generous portion of brown sugar boba is definitely a dessert to sum a sweet ending to a delicious taiwanese meal. The dessert is good for sharing as the portion is relatively huge so do remember to leave some stomach space for dessert.\nThe Salted Plum is definitely somewhere ideal for gathering with friends/ family to enjoy a hearty and comfort meal especially when you misses Taiwanese style food!\nThank you @sixthsensepr for the invite & warm hosting, @thesaltedplumsg for the yummy spread of food!"

When ordering the Yuzu Shabu set, you may opt for Japan Shirobuta Pork set ($26 per pax) which comprises of pork collar and top grade pork belly from Kyushu or Kaisen set ($32.50 per pax) for the seafood lover which comprises of mussel, seabass, prawns, squid ring & etc! On top of that each set also comprises of assorted vegetables, japanese fish cane, handmade prawn and shiitake mushroom paste, japan mizuna vegetable, japanese fish cake and not forgetting the signature yuzu soup base.\nAs I am someone who loves fish, I have decided to add on seabass ($6) to my shabu set. Personally, I feel that yuzu fans would love the hotpot as it is something refreshing yet you are able to taste the natural sweetness from the other ingredients.\nMy personal take is that it would have been better if you get to enjoy a pot on your own, instead of sharing the pot with your friends/ family, especially for individuals who might have allergic reaction to seafood.\nYuzutei is located at Interlocal Centre level 1 around Pasir panjang area and around 12 mins walk from Pasar Panjang MRT station. Right now as I am writing the post, I am already missing the Yuzu Hotpot😢, will definitely revisit the restaurant again some time soon probably to try the other items from the menu.\nThank you @hojiakstory for the recommendation & jioing to visit the restaurant together! 🙆🏻‍♀️"

The ingredients are cut in the central kitchen to ensure consistency amongst all outlets.\nThe signature meat & seafood roll ($13.80++) is another must order item, and it pairs well with the bee hoon! If you would like to enjoy it at home, frozen packed version are also available for purchase and you can just simply thaw & fry it and you will get to satisfy your craving for heizhor at anytime!\nTime to head down to any White Restaurant outlets to try the plate of Mala White Bee Hoon and do note that it is only available for a limited time period!\nThank you @whitebeehoonrestaurant for the invite & warm hosting!"

She explained that every kueh was freshly made onsite by hand using fresh ingredients.... resulting in the slightly elevated cost.\n🔼\nIt certainly was nice to see that this old school kueh making trade is bring kept alive by young entrepreneurs like Sharon.

While we were told that the steak carries a just a very slight hint of gaminess, the gaminess was barely detectable; tender and juicy, while the flavours were enhanced with the sprinkle of Maldon Seasalt at the side. Very delicious, and very value-for-money indeed at the quality it comes at!"

The broth tasted relatively the same, and the use of clams as an ingredient did not seem to add a bonus to ordering this dish.\nOK to splurge once in a while, but the motivation to return for more, is not anywhere near to high."

True to its roots, these oblong blocks of Swahili \"mochi\" are made with dragon fruit juice (hence the vibrancy), hazelnuts, cashew nuts, macadamia, pistachio, and Malindi spices.\nThe floral sweetness was a bit much for me, although it was slightly offset by the light coconut yogurt and dukkah filo.

A “love me tender” moment that left me crooning with sweet fervour.

As part of my go vegetarian once a week mission, I decided that it isn't that hard going without meat or seafood given how delicious vegetarian dishes can be. The rendang was chunky and it complemented well with the thick and slightly spicy rendang gravy. Would be best to eat this with rice as it can get quite spicy!"

The chicken came in enormous portions and as such soy garlic sauce can also be found on the fried chicken chicken. The interior of the chicken was rather bland even though it's soft. Also, the marination could be better as the chicken was a tad too salty. Overall, I would say it's still an eatery worth visiting!"

As easy as it looks, the trick lies in getting a batter that isn't too thick so that it could be crispy on the outside and yet still noisy and soft on the inside. I felt that this pancake has met my expectation but it would be better if it were a little crispier on the surface."

The matcha bun, that envelops the sausage, is light, buttery and fluffy with a sweet green-tea flavor that balances out the creamy richness of the savory smoked cheese and tangy sour cream. The gloppy beef chilli has mingled with the Big Poppa's hot sauce, giving a smokey, beefy and spicy kick, while the zesty, uplifting and fruity watermelon relish harmonizes with the heartiness of the chili and enlivens the dish."

The burger squelches as your teeth sinks into it, a fine spray of juices squirting out from every crevice of the closely packed granules of minced lamb. There are no frills or flamboyant flavor combinations in this burger. A 150-gram Australian Droper lamb patty is simply sandwiched in between two buttery and fluffy demi brioche buns with herbaceous pesto, crunchy lettuce, melted gooey quader de cavra cheese and dewy heirloom tomatoes. This burger, despite being striped down to the basic quintessential burger ingredients, still manages to hold its own among its extravagant counterparts on Three Buns' menu. It is effortlessly delicious, kudos to the executive decision of only using first-rate produce. The Sly Stallone prevails from the extremely tender, fatty and luscious lamb patty, with every molecule of meat engulfed in the lamb's own naturally sweet, savory and earthy flavors."

                "Review": "This messy monster of a burger tastes as amazingly complex as it looks. A massive block of Black Angus beef cheek is sous-vide for over 24-hours and fully saturated in rendang gravy that includes a blend of over 10 different spices and ingredients. Sliced cucumbers, pickled mooli, chopped chives, crispy shallots, minced red chili and coconut mayo are thrown into the irresistible jumble. All that delightful chaos is then contained within a pair of fluffy coconut buns made from coconut oil and coconut milk.\nThe long sous-vide process yields a buttery-soft texture for the Black Angus beef cheek with an intense melt-in-the-mouth effect. The dulcified beef cheek flakes apart with a perfunctory bite and is heavily inundated with thick streaks of sticky and gelatinous collagen which further intensifies its melty quality. The rendang gravy, redolent with fragrant spices, is sweet, spicy, nutty, hearty and chunky, and has a unique umami flavor that lingers at the back of the tongue even after the viscous beef has been ingested. The kaleidoscopic array of sliced cucumbers, pickled mooli, chopped scallions, crispy shallots and minced red chili add a sharp and invigorating crunch, providing a vital textural contrast to the soft and tender beef. The brilliant inclusion of the toasted demi brioche coconut buns, slathered in coconut mayo, acts as the perfect vessel in carrying the sweet and delicate perfumed aroma of coconuts which balances out the heavy and intense flavors of the rendang gravy."

                "Review": "The Ronnie is essentially the upper crust and more sophisticated cousin to the Sausage Egg McMuffin. A 90-gram chicken sausage patty is made in-house and assembled with a fried free-range egg, arugula and miso béarnaise, compounded in between two slices of toasted demi brioche. The buns are so light, airy and pillowy, that they practically disappear into a buttery poof of air as you bite down into the burger. The miso béarnaise is creamy, buttery and umami, with a subtle acidic twang that pierces through the richness of the sauce and arouses the palate. The molten golden core of the egg explodes upon impact and inundates the juicy and savory sausage patty with its yolky decadence, while the arugula rounds things up with its peppery and ever-green freshness. This brunch burger is accompanied by a side of tater tots which are crisp and savory on its golden-brown exterior, and fluffy and earthy in its interior. \n*The brunch menu is only available every Saturday and Sunday, from 11am to 4pm."

The yangnyeom is sweet, tangy and garlicky with just a hint of spice to cut through the syrupy sweetness, giving an intense burst of flavors to the popcorn chicken. Despite the deluge of the sticky Korean BBQ sauce, the chicken bites still manage to retain the crispiness of their savory shells which encapsulate morsels of succulent and tender chicken thigh meat within."

The vanilla ice cream itself, is churned daily in Three Buns' kitchen, to ensure that only the best ingredients are used in its creation and that it is as wonderfully fresh as it can possibly get. Pure Madagascan vanilla bean is used to create the vanilla ice cream, which is then blended with a splash of milk. The blender incorporates air into the concoction, resulting in the whipped and fluffy texture of the drink that tastes like a rich, milky and creamy cloud."

Every burger and hotdog on Three Buns' menu is so intensely succulent and flavorful that it brings beatific smiles to both humans and dogs alike.\nThree Buns is the new kid on the block in Robertson Quay, situated alongside the tranquil and susurrating Singapore River. Three Buns was conceived from the Potato Head family, which is an Indonesian lifestyle brand making waves throughout Jakarta, Bali, Hong Kong and Singapore for its sophisticated yet laid-back concept and ingenious gastronomy featured in its establishments.\nThree Buns is an award-winning restaurant that focuses on preparing its culinary offerings with premium meat, unique house-made sauces, inventive bun choices, and imaginative toppings. Fresh, creative, and distinct from the classics, this burger paradise presents the epitome of ambrosial comfort foods."

The first bite, texture of the skin is smooth, filling is flavourful, but wait... I bite onto something sharp and hard. A 0.7cm white \"stick\" I spat out. I try a second, this time a 0.3cm \"stick\". It's getting more exciting than catching a Pokemon, as my streak persist for the next 2 wantons. Decided to raise it to the kitchen staff across the open kitchen. \"Maybe it's the bone of anchovy/fried fish, that we use for flavour was not grinded well!\" he exclaims as he picks up the \"stick\" and much to my dismay threw it away and carried on his kitchen duties. As a matter of principles, they should have suggested replacing the bowl of $6 wanton or show some concern on the matter. This has certainly left an impression!"
