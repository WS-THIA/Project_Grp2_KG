This restaurant is always popular with the lunch crowd, and today was no exception, but I got my porridge order very quickly amidst other orders of Saba fish and hotplate meats.My perennial favourite is the korean beef porridge which is made with brown rice and barley stewed with a generous amount of dried scallops. This makes for such a creamy and rich porridge, there’s no such thing as bland or boring porridge here. The porridge is topped with beef and shredded seaweed. The beef is probably the same as what’s served for the hotplate beef, which is slightly spicy but so good because it’s sliced thin and tender. Sometimes the beef is a little inconsistent as there can be copious amounts of onions thrown in, but today that wasn’t an issue.

Been a fan of Chef Patrick @patrickheuberger since the good old days at Le Bistrot Du Sommelier - known for its hearty French cuisine prepared using traditional culinary techniques.The rabbit rillettes(made in-house) was adequately seasoned with no trace of gamey taste at all. The light and almost fluffy-like texture made it loose enough to be spread easily with a knife on the crusty toast. Love the vinegary little French pickles too!Chef Patrick thoughtfully offered to serve us a complimentary dessert while we were waiting for the heavy rain to stop. 😍😍 He also told us that he did not expect two ladies to polish off the bread, rillettes, white asparagus, forty garlic chicken and the pepper-crusted ribeye. 😂Enjoyed our meal here very much!#FrenchBistroDempsey #AtoutSg #PatrickHeuberger #Rabbit #Rillettes #FrenchCuisine #EileenWantsToCampHere #Burpple","asparagus,bread,chicken,dessert,ribeye,toast,vinegar",had a belated birthday meal at  with a well-loved friend the other day. been a fan of chef patrick  since the good old days at le bistrot du sommelier - known for its hearty french cuisine prepared using traditional culinary techniques. the rabbit rillettes(made in-house) was adequately seasoned with no trace of gamey taste at all. while we were waiting for the heavy rain to stop. 😍😍 😂enjoyed our meal here very much!       ,"the light and almost fluffy-like texture made it loose enough to be spread easily with a knife on the crusty toast. love the vinegary little french pickles too!chef patrick thoughtfully offered to serve us a complimentary dessert he also told us that he did not expect two ladies to polish off the bread, rillettes, white asparagus, forty garlic chicken and the pepper-crusted ribeye.","belated,loved,good,old,du,known,hearty,french,prepared,traditional,culinary,adequately seasoned,gamey,waiting,heavy,stop,😍,enjoyed","light,fluffy,like,loose,spread,crusty,love,vinegary,little,french,thoughtfully offered,serve,complimentary,told,expect,polish,white,garlic,crusted","loved,friend,fan,good,prepared,stop,😍,😂,enjoyed","like,loose,easily,love,thoughtfully,complimentary"

821,Tasting Menu [$80],"10 Jalan Serene, Singapore",Fat Belly,"1. Starter trio -Consommé: clarified beef bone broth, scallion oil (scallion oil really brought out the flavor and enhanced the richness of the broth)Savory tart: truffle mascarpone, 24 aged air dried beef (one bite goodness!)Financier: duck fat, foie gras mousse, fleur de sel(Interesting combination of sweet and umami)2. Short ribs - potato pavé, chimichuri, crème fraîche, smoked sea salt 3. Char siew - ribbed fingers, wilted spinach (almost thought i was having pork! Beef was a tad too fatty for my liking but the meat was well charred) 4. The bikini - homemade Wagyu bak kwa, Moroccan spice, emmental (interesting choice of using bak kwa here, I found it quite sweet. Would have prefer a more intense flavor like smoky brisket or some form of pulled beef. Emmental is also a rather mild option to use for a bikini. Cheddar could have contrasted better with the bak kwa) Palate cleanser served here - lime granita (very refreshing) 5. Tri tip - Auskobe A1 Wagyu marble score 4-5 tri tip, pomme purée, burnt shallots, smoked eryngii mushrooms (surprisingly amazed at the texture and consistency of the meat, great execution of medium rare. My only complain is that they don’t carry any types mustard. They do however, sell homemade sauces at $4 each, including bordelaise, chimichurri, green peppercorn) 6. Sweet - pistachio, sour cherry, meringue (very similar texture to a panna cotta! Love the nutty and richness from the pistachio, great contrast with the sour cherries) You’d notice that most people are there for the Burpple 1-1 tasting menu. What is interesting to note is that none of the items on the tasting menu is actually from the ala carte menu. I must say that the tasting menu definitely packs a lot of value for the price (even without the Burpple deal) and the ala carte menu does look enticing to me for a revisit! On the ala carte menu, You will find items like duck rillettes with figs for starters, baked Camembert cheese, hand crafted ricotta and plum under starters. And this place certainly pride itself for its charcoal grill where you get the option of topping up $17 for a choice of side and dessert.

885,Toman Fish Soup ($6.80),Singapore,Xin Wah Kee [email protected] Square,"Unimpressed with the service here at Xin Wah Kee. They have a few choices of soups - toman fish or red grouper, or you could opt for the seafood options at the same price as the fish soup counterparts with more varieties of seafood and less fish slices. I got the Toman Fish soup without any rice and noodles (+0.50 for rice, thick bee hoon, kuay tiao or mee sua). Originally wanted the set with you cai, but you can’t change the set as it comes with ngoh hiang. Bought the you cai separately instead which cost $2.80. The menu is quite inflexible, as I also wanted to get the chicken soup which they had advertised as a set with rice, veg and drinks. Unfortunately, you can’t order the chicken soup as an ala carte item so.. didn’t bother trying.Tastewise, the fish soup is not bad. It’s got a milky white finish and is quite thick, slightly sweet and nourishing. There’s no fishy smell, and the Toman fish slices have no bones, plus there’s quite a decent number of fish slices and large rectangles of silken tofu inside. There’s a hint of shaoxing wine, with tomato and cabbage. For the you cai, the vegetables were lightly poached which left them very crisp. However, the sauce was much sweeter than usual. It’d have been better if the sauce was less sweet and more savoury.We also got two pieces of prawn roll/ngoh hiang, but they weren’t nice. The rolls weren’t served hot, and the portion size looked miserable. While the meat was tender, the roll left a powdery feeling when bitten into, with a strange aftertaste.I doubt I’ll be visiting Xin Wah Kee again given the subpar service, sides and a mediocre fish soup.
