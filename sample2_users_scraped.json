Think the classic offerings of Roast Duck, Soy Sauce Chicken, Roast Pork, and Char Siew which the chef had he learnt to prepare from someone who honed his craft in Hong Kong. My favourite of the lot, the Soy Sauce Chicken 油鸡 ($8/lower quarter & $7/upper quarter) was succulent, savoury and saucey - perfect with a steaming bowl of rice. The Char Siew 叉烧 ($10 portion) was also well-executed though they were sliced much thinner than I preferred in order to cater to the more elderly customers that they get at the coffeeshop. Similarly, the Roast Duck 当归烤鸭 ($12/lower quarter & $11/upper quarter), which was initially done with a more pungent hit of dang gui was toned down with the feedback of the diners. Yet as one who loves a stronger herbal flavour, I am still able to appreciate the subtleness and the pairing with the natural sweetness of the meat. The mee kia too, was cooked to a springy perfection.\nThank you @alhsx for the kind invitation and @jthejon for the hospitality!\n.\n📌Tong Luo Wan 铜锣湾\nJin Biao Coffee Shop 锦标咖啡店\nBlock 136 Potong Pasir Ave 3"

Surprisingly good, the eel did not have any fishy odor and was quite plump. Fairly smoky, the best part of the charcoal-grilled unagi was the soft interior as some tend to dry out while trying to achieve the glisteningly crisp exterior in my opinion - so their rendition had both. As for the array of condiments, namely spring onions, wasabi, nori and dashi; they were pretty standard. Though my main qualms were that the dashi that lacked oomph and the slightly sweeter tare could be made more savoury. Nevertheless, it was a steal for the portion!"

The noodles saved the day as it was cooked springy, with tender charsiew and add-on 5 minute egg were on point. The other highlights were the crispy lard and their house shiok chilli a must try.\nWill I pay $5.50+ again for Seng's bowl of Wanton Noodles (U.P. $7 Roasted Pork Belly)? Yes I probably would."

The dish is good for sharing two person, but at a whopping low price of $18, I wouldn't mind having one fish all to myself.\nRead more at http://www.alainlicious.com/2015/06/singapore-restaurant-month-2015.html"

Some said that their thick toast were \"After You\" number 2, or probably better.\nI'll be back to try the other 5 flavours on the menu namely Gula Melaka, Matcha, Sticky Toffee, Classic Maple and Pina Colada."

The space is cozy, spacious with attentive service, plus you can finish your meal without smelling like a walking tempura😛\nThere are 3 types of tendon to choose from - Yasai ($12.80, assorted vegetables), Special ($14.80, prawn, egg and assorted vegetables) and my favourite would be the Premium Toku-Jo ($22.80, Anago, fish, crab leg, prawn, egg and assorted vegetables). Choice of spicy/ normal tare(sauce). Every set comes with miso soup and a very refreshing kyabetsu salad (sesame sauce’s served on the side so add as you like!). \nEach ingredient was lightly battered, not too greasy; the sauces were well-balanced and not overly generous so it doesn’t overpower the rest of the bowl. And most importantly, the batter remained crispy for a long time even after a bit of a photography session frenzy. I loved how the vegetables remained juicy and moist, very delicate and crisp shiso leaf and the flavourful free range egg. No flowy egg porn but oozy enough!\nThank you @tenjinsg for having us, Agnes for your kind hospitality and #burpple for extending the invite!😋"

I loved their calm and inviting space tucked on the 3rd floor of Shaw Centre. \nWe got to try their new inaniwa udon set that came with cold udon, mentsuyu, assorted tempura and kyabetsu salad. Was very happy to see it on the menu as it’s one of my favorite kinds of udon! Though the tempura should be the star of the show, the thin noodles didn’t lose out at all. They were chewy, smooth and picked up its light sauce very well. As with the other bowls, the lightly battered tempura were cleanly fried and not at all greasy. Will surely be back!\nThank you @tenjinsg for having us and @burpple for the kind invite! ✨"

You get six pieces of spinach and ricotta ravioli in truffled mushroom cream, with a dome-shaped bread cover that’s cut open upon serving. Found the ravioli skin to be a bit too thick, but we still enjoyed it a lot as a whole! \nTruffle was subtle, but the sauce was more like a thick and creamy mushroom soup with generous chunks of mushrooms. It was great for dipping with the bread cover that was crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. \nLa Pizzeria was a little out of the way, but we sat outdoors and was rewarded with a pretty sunset. Another plus point, Burpple Beyond is available here for 1 for 1 pizzas/pasta!"

Tai Dong’s different as they only offer white rice as their carb, but it’s fab! Their braised sauce is very flavourful and not overly salty. \nThough the duck slices were not the most tender depending on the part you get, but they’re very thoroughly braised and tasty especially with the duck skin on! Of the sides, please make sure to get their addictive stewed cabbage. They were probably stewed for hours as they were so soft! We also loved the smooth braised bean curd, braised eggs and duck livers. If you need more braised sauce, pop back to the stall and they’d be happy to add on!"

Spare parts. Red Curry Mixed Veg and their signature braised pork. It’s all in the dipping sauce that makes it Thai. Chicken is tender and soft a bit similar to our local Hainanese or Cantonese style chicken without the gelatinous layer. Braised Pork, the mrs said her version is much better. It’s not bad lah, but can’t compare to Mrs Lim’s version. Lol. The Red Curry Mixed vegetables is nice, if only it was even spicier it would be nicer. We like it spicy. Thai Milk Tea is not as sweet as we thought it will be, so we are happy. We quickly ate, laid and left because there was a queue waiting. Need to do our weekly groceries after lunch."

And pictured here is one of the items he has dreamed up that is sure to have them gasping in delight. Not once but twice: when it’s first served and again, when they put the sushi in their mouths.\nPiled on the “shari” (Japanese sushi rice) are double portions of fatty tuna prepared in two ways (as a thick-cut piece and minced), caviar and a piece of shimmering gold leaf.

Served with brown rice and yam.\nThe chicken sauce is slightly sweet and has a little bit of a nutty flavour to it. I would personally prefer it without the glutinous rice since the dish is already served with brown rice. And my other gripe is that there's not enough sauce in the dish. The brow rice can be a little dry and hard to finish without sauce to mix with it."

You're supposed to take it and dip it into the broth so that the shell soaks in the flavour and becomes soft. But I quite enjoy the dumpling crisp instead as the fillings are already of a tender texture. The broth tastes nice with the dumpling, but I wouldn't drink it on its own as the flavour was a little strong for me."

I was really impressed with the skewer rotating system that allows the meat to be cooked perfectly above the heated coal.\nThe Korean Fusion restaurant has been around for about 6 months with a chill, simple yet really well thought out space.\nEvery seat has a compartment underneath to keep your bag off the ground. I really appreciate it when restaurants take into consideration where you're going to keep your bag whilst eating. Apart from that, we noticed that the exhaust system runs under the raised flooring. Which means no smokey room and no large exhaust tube hanging in the middle of the table so you can't see your friends sitting across form you.\nSeems like a great place if you want to chill with friends whilst enjoying skewers and beers. They have Korean sodas too if beer isn't your thing. They're open till 3am in the morning so if you're a night owl…\nThis place is a short walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT near the junction of Craig Rd and Duxton Rd. And you can easily make reservations using Chope app!\n— Kko Chi Bar —\n10 Craig Rd, Singapore 089670\n#KkoChiBar #ChopeSG"

The curry was not overly creamy but it had enough flavour that infused the crab meat unlike most of the other crab dishes where the crab was merely tossed in or drizzled over with sauce.

Any random shop anywhere here in kimchi land will taste good, okay maybe not for their daikon and kimchis for some shops, but still yums.\nDipping the diced chicken meat into the melted morzarella cheese, adding a little kimchi, noming it down with some rice, and shredded mayo lettuce for the extra crunch screams superb awesomeness.\nThis shop is their 2nd branch at Myeongdong, Seoul, Jung-gu Myeong-dong2-ga 55-8 2, 3 Floor, the location tag should be for their 1st branch.\n#whati8today #burpple #8dayseat #myeongdong #yoogane #spicychicken #chicken #korea #koreafood #tagforlikes #coldnoodles #seafoodpancake #cheese #cheesychicken #lunch #koreanfood #korean #sgfood #sgfoods #sgfoodies #sgfoodie"

The fish batter was coated just right, not too thick like Long John's, you can still see the fish skin through that fried batter, and it was still crispy when the knife sliced though it! I added a drink and made the whole bill at around $15, for any first try I don't mind spending a lil more though, since I'm here, might as well right!\nSelf squeezed sauces on their condiments area, tried their curry mayo, chili sauce and XO mayo, for myself the curry mayo was really the bomb, somewhat similar taste to mcd's curry sauce, except that you can taste more of the curry spice and the sauce was more viscous than the former. I wonder why the placed wasn't crowded even though it was during lunch time, worth revisiting again!

There are only two soup variations on the menu of the world's only Michelin-starred ramen restaurant — shio (salt) or shoyu (soy sauce). Both soup bases stem from a chicken stock boiled with vegetables, clams and seafood for additional depth — think of it as soul-warming chicken noodle soup. Go for the crowd favourite Char Siu Ajitama Shoyu Soba ($22.80) that comes with the full works — four slices of char siu, flavoured egg, bamboo shoot and leek. The Tsuta rendition gets an unexpected umami boost from the scoop of truffle pureed in truffle oil. Otherwise, shio purists will enjoy tucking into the Char Siu Ajitama Shio Soba ($22.80). It comes with the same toppings, except that the the truffle is replaced by green olives in truffle oil.\nAvg Price: $25 per person\nPhoto by Burpple Tastemaker Eleanor Tay"

For all that truffle extravagance, I’d say this is worth event scent, and also worth your every cent!\n•\n[Hosted] #singaporefood #singaporefoodies #sgfood #eatoutsg #exploresg #eatandbrunch #sgfoodstagram #foodhunting #singaporefood #sgfoodguide #exploreflavours #igfood #instafood #instafoodsg #burpple #FoodPics #foodphotography #WhereKarlEats #stfoodtrending #sgfoodies #sgfoodblogger #tablescapesg #europeancuisine #grandparkhotelcityhall #michelinguide #sgfinedining #beautifulcuisine #hungrygowhere #trufflepasta"

Been a fan of Chef Patrick @patrickheuberger since the good old days at Le Bistrot Du Sommelier - known for its hearty French cuisine prepared using traditional culinary techniques.\nThe rabbit rillettes(made in-house) was adequately seasoned with no trace of gamey taste at all. The light and almost fluffy-like texture made it loose enough to be spread easily with a knife on the crusty toast. Love the vinegary little French pickles too!\nChef Patrick thoughtfully offered to serve us a complimentary dessert while we were waiting for the heavy rain to stop. 😍😍 He also told us that he did not expect two ladies to polish off the bread, rillettes, white asparagus, forty garlic chicken and the pepper-crusted ribeye. 😂Enjoyed our meal here very much!\n#FrenchBistroDempsey #AtoutSg #PatrickHeuberger #Rabbit #Rillettes #FrenchCuisine #EileenWantsToCampHere #Burpple"

The stall front is covered with many accolades won over the years — a testament to how good their dishes are. Follow our Burpple community's recommendation and get the Fried Egg with Oysters ($10). Unlike the starchy oyster eggs we're used to, the version here is an omelette topped with a generous portion of plump oysters. Burppler Hwans Lim highly recommends coming with a group of four or more to share the Fish Steamboat (market price). It comes ladened with plenty of fresh fish slices, yam cubes and tomatoes. Also worth sharing are the XL-sized Homemade Prawn Roll (Hei Zho)($8) — unlike other places where the hei zho comes in bite-sized pieces, here they do a lemon-sized version that requires more than a bite to finish.\nAvg Price: $20 per person\nPhoto by Burppler Jeremy Tan"

Special mention goes to the chicken, which we all know can get tough and chalky if overcooked; here, even the breast meat was delightfully tender.\nThere are two varieties for each meat stew – a non-spicy soy sauce base and a spicy gochujang (red pepper paste) one that is further customisable with 4 levels of spice. But regardless of whichever stew base you choose, the meat itself is absolutely delicious, reeking of a marinade in which it's soaked overnight for guaranteed flavour.\nI could go on about the DIY mixed grain rice balls – I still can't decide whether I love the anchovy or tuna better! – but I'll leave that for another time. Also, the crispy-chewy Korean pancakes are a MUST-TRY, with not-so-traditional flavours like potato and tomato & cheeeeeeeeese.\nOkay, now please excuse me while I wipe the drool off my face."

The oil from the beef had melted into the rice, which was exactly what I liked. Superb bowl of Don from a ramen place."

We enjoyed what we had, grilled prawn, crab croquettes and especially the grilled octopus that was on point.\nWe picked their spiced glazed pork belly which was spectacular and yummy good, flavourful and great meat-fats proportions that was pleasant to enjoy.\nThere were more appealing sounding items on their mains, pasta and risotto list for a sumptuous meal. Similarly for their appetisers that we liked. But we were glad we saved space for dessert as the red wine poached pear we had was really memorable to end with.\nWe would recommend to wine and dine here after having some of their cocktails and absolutely loving them. Have a little chat with Mr Star who may concoct some special mix in your drinks if you’re not going for the wine.\nThe interior of @mpiresingapore was chic and cosy, for a formal date or comfortable gathering. The final highlight: members of @burpplebeyond would be delighted to enjoy the incredible valuable deals here. So sharing this good find, hopefully not at the expense of being harder to get a table next time."

Unfortunately, we didn’t really enjoy both of them.\nThe soup was flavourful and rich with all that prawn stock one would desire; but it was a little salty for us. Our prawns were pretty big but we couldn’t find those umami roe in the heads that we loved, although the meat was still good. The pork ribs were disappointing. Not the tender juicy meat and they tasted separate from the prawn mee itself.\nSo we later learnt that Xing Ji relocated from Suntec. Not our favourite prawn mee, but guessed this would still be 1 place to share a popular local dish with those within the comfort of the shopping mall."

The meal would end with red tea jelly if there was still space in the stomach for it.\nIt was a very comprehensive set with lots of meat, seafood and vegetables.

The fluffy steamed egg came looking awesome with piping hot steam. It certainly tasted great too with a distinct “Wok Hei”. For grilled meat, their Kalbi was flavourful and served with rice for a complete meal.\nWith a succinct menu featuring popular elements of Korean cuisines, we would return to satisfy our craving for Korean food."

They do have noodle alternative too.\nBut a meal here should not stop with just their chicken rice. And their Thai steamed fish would be a must-try, with that kick-ass sour and spicy sauce on a fresh sea bass that we had.\nIn addition, we had their Chai Po omelette, braised pork belly and curry Chap Chye which were also delicious and completed our satisfying meal. We just loved the various sauces that came with different dishes.\nNo doubt we do have good chicken rice places of our own, but this is also one good chicken rice worthy of mention.

Frankly, neither impressed us in ways we expected them to be.\nThe cheese Hamburg didn’t stand out in flavour even though it was filled with a cheese center. The thin slices of Wagyu were fatty but lacked the grill finishing which was a real pity.\nIronically, we enjoyed their salad bar and egg station more than the mains. The former offered quite a substantial range for salad mix. Their free-flow tamago was the best thing for the meal; but it wouldn’t make sense to come and pay to mainly enjoy that. Unfortunately, the tamago was the only thing we remembered after the meal."

Their lamb chops are so well seasoned and chargrilled that there is zero game and the meat breaks away. Labanese cuisine is also known for their kofta and mashwi which a mixed platter would be ideal to try them all. Whereas Mezza Platter ($31.50) allows you to try their appetising dips such as grilled eggplant with herbs and chickpea which is surprisingly good. To think all the flavours of the dishes complemented well and dont clash, i give it to the chef. And no labanese meal is complete without Laban Aryan drinks made from fresh yogurt and recommended to have fruity flavoured ones for beginners ($8.90). We prefer their Strawberry Ayran. An idea for your sundate or gatherings along 14 Bussorah Street."

Served warm after just being fried, it was squiggled with loads of chestnut cream and feathered with crunchy cornflakes that had an addictive buttery saltiness. A generous swirl of creamy matcha soft serve (made in-house) crowned this divine creation. I also like that it's big enough to share between two people. \nIt seems Brother Bird has about 10 flavours of soft serve in total, and will be rolling out a couple of them each time. I think it's exciting to have a series of new soft serve concoctions to look forward to. Yay! "

The Anchorvale Food Court is part of block 303 which is a multi story car park. The chef, Ah Tan, serves a delicious plate of FKT which he learned to cook it right from his father who ran the same name stall in a coffee shop in Armenian Street. Almost every string of mee and kway teow is covered with egg which make it tasty to bite. There’s the juicy see hum (cockles), slices of fish cake and slices of quality Chinese sausage fried just right to complement the whole dish. Wok hee is good and the FTK is not too wet nor dry. What I love about it is that it’s not too sweet nor salty. The dish I had was $3 with a $1 worth of cockles. It’s really yummy delicious. Stall is closed every Thursdays. Opens from about 11 am till sold out before dinner."

Just for $3 you’ll get a bowl of well cooked noodles with chilli sauce and vinegar (if you prefer). The fishballs are definitely handmade and is tasty and bounces as you bite. I added $1.50 for the deep fried fish cake and it’s just as good as the fish balls. No wonder he has a following from Toa Payoh where he was before here."

With various tones of grey & silver, the style is very metallic, almost like the interior of a spaceship. \nOne downside is that reception was pretty bad here.. I sat at the bar, not sure if it varies throughout the premises as they don't have a huge space). WiFi also isn't for public use, so I left after 1 beer.

It honestly doesn't look like much, but it tastes pretty good. The scrambled eggs are creamy & slightly runny, just the way I like them. I just admit that the sausage gives the dish saltiness in good proportion. The sliced sourdough bread was impressively toasted to perfection! Crust not too hard (still easy to bite into), & the soft part of the bread pillowy & fluffy.\nI do hope they consider putting just Scrambled Eggs on Sourdough Toast on its own on the menu.

I would eat these again.\nPlus points for self service ginger & vinegar - I always load up on the ginger, with minimal vinegar. & yet another one: This stall accepts GrabPay, so yay for cashless transactions & earning Grab points! \nMade my way home with frozen goodies in tow: Xiao Long Baos 小笼包 go for $10 a bag of 20 pieces, Dumplings 水饺 at $12 for a bag of 30 pieces."

I'm not sure if you're supposed to taste the fats (in this case, coconut oil - I could only smell, not taste it), but I couldn't & I hope it stays that way. Because I am very fat-averse 😂\nI liked the flavours of this cocktail. The well-balanced tartness & sweetness of the applejack was lovely. On top of this, the layered fragrance of the lime kaffir & sweet vermouth sous vide pandan leaves were somewhat comforting. \nBefore my drink even arrived, I was served a glass of cold water that was regularly topped up throughout my evening.

Think BLT, but upgraded to an even better form with 1) candied bacon and 2) BUNDT’s signature smashed avocado.\nEverything about this sandwich is on point. There’s a mix of sweet and savoury flavours all throughout this sandwich that work like a charm. The candied bacon is not too sweet, plus it’s just crispy enough and easy to bite off and chew. Look at the amount of avocado they give! It’s literally piled on top of both slices of toast and effectively sandwich the lettuce, bacon and tomatoes. I usually don’t like raisins but they work well in the toast to add some juiciness and sweetness to the bread. It’s messy to eat this sandwich especially once the avocado starts spilling out from the base, but everything just falls into the paper bag anyway so it’s okay, you can dig it out later without being judged.\nThe only gripe I have is that it would’ve been better if served toasty warm, but I guess it’s kinda hard to prepare hot toast quickly given the small space they have and the speed at which they hare to serve."

Had the quinoa bowl for breakfast and it’s so yummy! This is one of the few places that we actually say “there’s so much avocado and we don’t have enough ingredients!” but that’s a good thing. The quinoa bowl is just the right portion for a meal without a carb overload. The cashew pesto chicken was a little of a letdown, id rather have gone for the Ma La chicken as today’s cashew pesto seemed rather tasteless compared to the cashew pesto herbivore with roasted portobello that we got last week. The chicken was nice and tender but not seasoned much, so I’d recommend the ma la over this for sure.\nPro tip:\n- if you want to maximise the smashed avocado, go for the options on sourdough\n- if you want more roasted tomatoes and corn, go for the carb free mesclun salad base\n- if you want a little bit of everything, go for the quinoa bowl/corn chips/tortilla wrap"

They have a few choices of soups - toman fish or red grouper, or you could opt for the seafood options at the same price as the fish soup counterparts with more varieties of seafood and less fish slices. \nI got the Toman Fish soup without any rice and noodles (+0.50 for rice, thick bee hoon, kuay tiao or mee sua). Originally wanted the set with you cai, but you can’t change the set as it comes with ngoh hiang. Bought the you cai separately instead which cost $2.80. The menu is quite inflexible, as I also wanted to get the chicken soup which they had advertised as a set with rice, veg and drinks. Unfortunately, you can’t order the chicken soup as an ala carte item so.. didn’t bother trying.\nTastewise, the fish soup is not bad. It’s got a milky white finish and is quite thick, slightly sweet and nourishing. There’s no fishy smell, and the Toman fish slices have no bones, plus there’s quite a decent number of fish slices and large rectangles of silken tofu inside. There’s a hint of shaoxing wine, with tomato and cabbage. \nFor the you cai, the vegetables were lightly poached which left them very crisp. However, the sauce was much sweeter than usual. It’d have been better if the sauce was less sweet and more savoury.\nWe also got two pieces of prawn roll/ngoh hiang, but they weren’t nice. The rolls weren’t served hot, and the portion size looked miserable. While the meat was tender, the roll left a powdery feeling when bitten into, with a strange aftertaste.\nI doubt I’ll be visiting Xin Wah Kee again given the subpar service, sides and a mediocre fish soup. There’s other places that I’d go for a fish soup craving, and other places that I’d rather spend my money and calories at in Velocity."

This restaurant is always popular with the lunch crowd, and today was no exception, but I got my porridge order very quickly amidst other orders of Saba fish and hotplate meats.\nMy perennial favourite is the korean beef porridge which is made with brown rice and barley stewed with a generous amount of dried scallops. This makes for such a creamy and rich porridge, there’s no such thing as bland or boring porridge here. The porridge is topped with beef and shredded seaweed. The beef is probably the same as what’s served for the hotplate beef, which is slightly spicy but so good because it’s sliced thin and tender. Sometimes the beef is a little inconsistent as there can be copious amounts of onions thrown in, but today that wasn’t an issue. \nAt only $5.50 for a hearty and filling bowl, this is one of my favourite porridges around, and one that can go toe to toe with Empress Porridge right around the corner!"

Theoretically they should be the same portion since they are under the same group, but Toss & Turn has once again proven how value for money their salad option is.\nWhat’s in my bowl:\nBase - soba, romaine lettuce\nProtein - 2 cold (spicy chicken and brined tuna)\nToppings - eggplant, corn kernels, bell peppers and pumpkin\nDressing - cashew lime \nJust look at how much meat I was given for $11! I managed to get the spicy mayo chicken chunks and brined tuna, and I’m not sure if it was close to closing time which was why I got an extra huge helping of the protein (the orange part on top is totally chicken, and the bottom half was tuna which has been obscured by the four toppings). Super super value for money given the portion size and makes for a very fulfilling and delicious meal! With the seasoned proteins, I didn’t even need the cashew lime dressing. \nNot a fancy salad place by any means, but one that provides a wide spread of consistently good and value for money ingredients!"

Starter trio -\nConsommé: clarified beef bone broth, scallion oil (scallion oil really brought out the flavor and enhanced the richness of the broth)\nSavory tart: truffle mascarpone, 24 aged air dried beef (one bite goodness!)\nFinancier: duck fat, foie gras mousse, fleur de sel\n(Interesting combination of sweet and umami)\n2. Short ribs - potato pavé, chimichuri, crème fraîche, smoked sea salt \n3. Char siew - ribbed fingers, wilted spinach (almost thought i was having pork! Beef was a tad too fatty for my liking but the meat was well charred) \n4. The bikini - homemade Wagyu bak kwa, Moroccan spice, emmental (interesting choice of using bak kwa here, I found it quite sweet. Would have prefer a more intense flavor like smoky brisket or some form of pulled beef. Emmental is also a rather mild option to use for a bikini. Cheddar could have contrasted better with the bak kwa) \nPalate cleanser served here - lime granita (very refreshing) \n5. Tri tip - Auskobe A1 Wagyu marble score 4-5 tri tip, pomme purée, burnt shallots, smoked eryngii mushrooms (surprisingly amazed at the texture and consistency of the meat, great execution of medium rare. My only complain is that they don’t carry any types mustard. They do however, sell homemade sauces at $4 each, including bordelaise, chimichurri, green peppercorn) \n6. Sweet - pistachio, sour cherry, meringue (very similar texture to a panna cotta! Love the nutty and richness from the pistachio, great contrast with the sour cherries) \nYou’d notice that most people are there for the Burpple 1-1 tasting menu. What is interesting to note is that none of the items on the tasting menu is actually from the ala carte menu. I must say that the tasting menu definitely packs a lot of value for the price (even without the Burpple deal) and the ala carte menu does look enticing to me for a revisit! \nOn the ala carte menu, You will find items like duck rillettes with figs for starters, baked Camembert cheese, hand crafted ricotta and plum under starters. And this place certainly pride itself for its charcoal grill where you get the option of topping up $17 for a choice of side and dessert. Charcoal grill items range between $22 to $65, from a simple angus reserve 150 day grain fed flat iron steak to a more indulgent cut like the 400 day grain fed crossbred wagyu marble score 8/9 deckle or a Mayura signature marble score 9+ Wagyu tri tip.\n"

Shiok!\n🙂\nThe standard English was however a disappointment! Scrambled eggs were too dense, sausage was tasteless & dry, toasted brioche was overly dried. Only saving grace was the fresh juicy tomato & slightly salty tender Canadian bacon. Overall we felt that this dish was served out from a microwave. Sad\n😔\nWe were glad to have Sweet Morning ($20) for a sweet ending. Crispy brioche french toast stuffed with grilled mango. Yum!\n😋\n#burpple"
