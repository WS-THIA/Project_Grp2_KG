sated caramel banana brioche french toast ($15),"the french toast was light and fluffy, carrying a cinnamon fragrance. my only gripe was that the toast was slightly dry. nevertheless, served with caramelised bananas, berries and an artful brush of caramel sauce, this plate was a delightful way to start my weekend. using burpple beyond for this also made my wallet happier ðŸ˜‹"
bacon carbonara ($15),this dish tasted homely and comforting with its creamy and milky sauce that covered every strand of al dente spaghetti without being cloying. bacon bits were studded throughout the pasta and parmesan shavings also generously topped it off to enhance its richness.
big brekkie ($19),"this dish boasted generous portions with uncompromising taste. i liked how you can choose from 3 different kinds of eggs - scrambled, onsen or sunny side up. my choice of onsen egg was perfectly jiggly and went well with the toast, though larger toast portions would better balance out the entire plate as I felt that every other aspect of this dish tasted better when paired with the toast, yet there wasnâ€™t enough to go around. despite that though, the sausage was sizeable with a substantial chew without being overtly oily. the avocado and mushrooms were also well seasoned."
All In Break kid,$19 (1 for 1 available). Lovely and generous spread. Will come back!
Cosy cafe along upper Thomson,"We had gashouse eggs ($13), smashed avo toast ($13) - with burpple beyond - and a flat white ($5). The gashouse eggs were cheesy with a runny yolk and the bacon jam was a nice crunchy complement. The avo toast was not soggy at all and I like the crunch of the almonds."
French Toast ($15),"An oldie but a goodie, One Man Coffeeâ€™s French Toast is a pick-me-up any time of the week! Fluffy brioche, candied walnuts, salted caramel and fresh fruits (dat caramelised banana mmmmm). Sounds like it might be too sweet, but I thought it was quite well balanced, or just get this to share, you wonâ€™t regret it either way. Psst, 1-for-1 here with #BurppleBeyond!"
